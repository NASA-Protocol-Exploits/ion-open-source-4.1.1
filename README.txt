To build and install the entire ION system on a Linux, OS/X, or Solaris
platform, cd into ion-open-source and enter three commands:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

NOTE: if you want to set overriding compile-time switches for a build, 
the place to do this is in the ./configure command.  For details,

	./configure -h

To build ION for Android, cd into ion-open-source/arch-android and
see the instructions in the README.bionic text file.

To build ION for RTEMS, cd into ion-open-source/arch-rtems and
see the instructions in the README text file.

To build ION for Windows, see the instructions in the "Building ION from source
on Windows.pdf" document.

To build ION for the ARM-based AT91SAM9G20 board, cd into
ion-open-source/arch-uClibc and see the instructions in the
"ARM build.pdf" file. 

It's also possible to build the individual packages of ION, using
platform-specific Makefiles in the package subdirectories.  If you choose
this option, be aware of the dependencies among the packages:

	The "ici" package must be built ("make" and "make install")
	before any other package.

	The "bp" package is dependent on "dgr" and "ltp" and "bssp"
	as well as "ici".

	The "cfdp", "ams", "bss", and "dtpc" packages are dependent on "bp".

	The "restart" package is dependent on "cfdp", "bp", "ltp",
	and "ici".

Also, be aware that these Makefiles install everything into subdirectories
of /usr/local.  To override this behavior, change the value of OPT in the
top-level Makefile of each package.

Additional details are provided in the README.txt files in the root
directories of some of the subsystems.

Note that all Makefiles are for gmake; on a freebsd platform, be sure
to install gmake before trying to build ION.
