=head1 NAME

karecv - DTKA user daemon task for receiving newly generated public keys

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<karecv>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<karecv> is a background "daemon" task that receives new public key assertions
multicast by DTKA user nodes' B<knclock> daemons and records those assertions
in a database for future processing by B<kacompile>.  It is spawned
automatically by B<kaadmin> in response to the 's' command that starts
operation of the DTKA key authority function, and it is terminated by
B<kaadmin> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item "0"

B<karecv> terminated, for reasons noted in the B<ion.log> file.  If this
termination was not commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified
in the log file and use B<kaadmin> to restart B<karecv>.

=item "1"

B<karecv> was unable to attach to DTKA operations, probably because
B<kaadmin> has not yet been run.
