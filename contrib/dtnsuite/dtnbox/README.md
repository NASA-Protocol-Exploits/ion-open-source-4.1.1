# DTNbox
DTNbox is a program for directory synchronization between DTN nodes. DTNbox differs from other synchronization programs because is peer-to-peer and is based on the bundle protocol. These characteristics make it well suited for challenged networks, including a future Interplanetary Internet.

DTNbox is part of the DTNsuite, which consists of several DTN applications making use of the Abstraction Layer, plus the Abstraction Layer itself.

Being built on top of the Abstraction layer, DTNbox is compatible with all the most important bundle protocol implementations (DTN2, ION, IBR_DTN).
