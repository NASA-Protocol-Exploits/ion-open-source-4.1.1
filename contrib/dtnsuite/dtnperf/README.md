# DTNperf
DTNperf_3 is the third major version of the DTNperf tool, developed at University of Bologna. From release 3.6.0, it is part of the DTNsuite, which consists of several DTN applications that make use of the Abstraction Layer, plus the Abstraction Layer itself.

As suggested by its name, DTNperf is a tool for performance evaluation in Bundle Protocol DTN environments.

Being built on top of the Abstraction layer, DTNperf is compatible with all the most important bundle protocols implementations (DTN2, ION, IBR_DTN).
