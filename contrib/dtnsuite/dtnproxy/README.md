# DTNproxy
DTNproxy is a DTN application developed at University of Bologna to allow file transfers from TCP/IP and DTN nodes and vice versa. It is part of the DTNsuite, which consists of several DTN applications making use of the Abstraction Layer, plus the Abstraction Layer itself.

Being built on top of the Abstraction layer, DTNproxy is compatible with all the most important bundle protocol implementations (DTN2, ION, IBR_DTN).
