# Initialization command (command 1).

# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	The scheme's number is 1.  Note that this number is defined for
#	Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) schemes ONLY.  All other
#	schemes (dtn for example) should use number -1.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'

# Add endpoints.
#	Establish endpoints ipn:1.1 and ipn:1.2 on the local node.
#	The behavior for receiving a bundle when there is no application
#	currently accepting bundles, is to queue them 'q', as opposed to
#	immediately and silently discarding them (use 'x' instead of 'q' to
#	discard).
a endpoint ipn:1.1 q
a endpoint ipn:1.2 q
a endpoint ipn:1.3 q

# Add a protocol. 
a protocol udp 1400 100

# Add an induct. (listen)
# (none--that's what netcat is for) a induct udp 127.0.0.1:4556 udpcli

# Add an outduct. (since one UDP socket can address any IP, use '*' 
# for the destination address, then this clo can send to any udp cli)
a outduct udp 127.0.0.1:4556 'udpclo 2'
