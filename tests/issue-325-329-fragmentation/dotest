echo "PURPOSE: Testing modifications for issues 325 and 329, bundle replication.
	This test exercises the partial replication that is done when a bundle
	is fragmented, i.e., it is split into two bundles containing different
	portions of the original bundle's payload.  To test this capability,
	we use bpsendfile to send a file that is larger than a single UDP
	datagram, from a node whose only convergence-layer adapter is UDP.
	The file is initially encapsulated in a single bundle, but as udpclo
	dequeues bundles for transmission it forces that bundle to be fragmented
	into multiple bundles that are small enough for transmission by UDP;
	at the destination node, the fragments are reassembled so that the
	complete orginal bundle payload can be reconstituted and written to
	the file system by bprecvfile.  The test succeeds if the destination
	file is identical to the source file."
