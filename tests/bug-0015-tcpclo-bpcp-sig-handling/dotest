# Bug 0015 tcpclo and bpcp signal handling and semaphore signal interruptions
# Samuel Jero
# March 5, 2013
# The issue-358-cfdp-inactivity and issue-352-bpcp tests are sufficient
# to validate that the tcpclo and bpcp/bpcpd signal handlers work correctly.
# This test ensures that ION correctly handles semaphore operations that
# get interrupted by a signal. We do a simple loopback tcp transfer and
# run a simple program that constantly attempts to perform a transaction.
# We then fire a bunch of signals at this simple program. We then check
# ion.log for failed assertions which would indicate a hijacked transaction.
