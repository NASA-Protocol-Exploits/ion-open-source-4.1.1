# bprc configuration file for the loopback test.

#	This command should be run AFTER ionadmin and ltpadmin and 
#	BEFORE ipnadmin or dtnadmin.

# Add an EID scheme.
#	The scheme's name is ipn.
#	This scheme's forwarding engine is handled by the program 'ipnfw.'
#	This scheme's administration program (acting as the custodian
#	daemon) is 'ipnadminep.'
a scheme ipn 'ipnfw' 'ipnadminep'

# Add endpoints.
#	Establish endpoints ipn:1.1 and ipn:1.2 on the local node.
#	The behavior for receiving a bundle when there is no application
#	currently accepting bundles, is to queue them 'q', as opposed to
#	immediately and silently discarding them (use 'x' instead of 'q' to
#	discard).
#	Note that the custodian endpoint ipn:1.0 is automatically generated.
a endpoint ipn:1.1 x
a endpoint ipn:1.2 x
a endpoint ipn:1.64 x
a endpoint ipn:1.65 x

# Add a protocol. 
#	Add the protocol named ltp.
#	Estimate transmission capacity assuming 1400 bytes of each frame (in
#	this case, udp on ethernet) for payload, and 100 bytes for overhead.
a protocol ltp 1400 100

# Add an induct. (listen)
#	Add an induct to accept bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 1 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	induct).
#	The induct itself is implemented by the 'ltpcli' command.
a induct ltp 1 ltpcli

# Add an outduct. (send to yourself)
#	Add an outduct to send bundles using the ltp protocol.
#	The duct's name is 1 (this is for future changing/deletion of the
#	outduct).
#	The outduct itself is implemented by the 'ltpclo' command.
a outduct ltp 1 ltpclo
