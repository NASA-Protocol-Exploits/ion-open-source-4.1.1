# This test pertains to issue #313 "Overlapping memcpy in BP bundle acquisition system".
# This test sends multiple several bundles inside an LTP segment to ensure that
# they are correctly separated out without corruption. The first part checks
# for error messages in the log file indicitive of corruption. The second part uses
# cfdptest to send a file as a sequence of many bundles and verifies that
# the file was received correctly.
