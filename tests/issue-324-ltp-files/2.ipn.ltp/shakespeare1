   185 THE SONNETS
   186 
   187 by William Shakespeare
   188 
   189 
   190 
   191                      1
   192   From fairest creatures we desire increase,
   193   That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
   194   But as the riper should by time decease,
   195   His tender heir might bear his memory:
   196   But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
   197   Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
   198   Making a famine where abundance lies,
   199   Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
   200   Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
   201   And only herald to the gaudy spring,
   202   Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
   203   And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
   204     Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
   205     To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
   206 
   207 
   208                      2
   209   When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
   210   And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
   211   Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
   212   Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
   213   Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
   214   Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
   215   To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
   216   Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
   217   How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
   218   If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
   219   Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
   220   Proving his beauty by succession thine.
   221     This were to be new made when thou art old,
   222     And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
   223 
   224 
   225                      3
   226   Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
   227   Now is the time that face should form another,
   228   Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
   229   Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
   230   For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
   231   Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
   232   Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
   233   Of his self-love to stop posterity?
   234   Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
   235   Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
   236   So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
   237   Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
   238     But if thou live remembered not to be,
   239     Die single and thine image dies with thee.
   240 
   241 
   242                      4
   243   Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
   244   Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
   245   Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
   246   And being frank she lends to those are free:
   247   Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
   248   The bounteous largess given thee to give?
   249   Profitless usurer why dost thou use
   250   So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
   251   For having traffic with thy self alone,
   252   Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,
   253   Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
   254   What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
   255     Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
   256     Which used lives th' executor to be.
   257 
   258 
   259                      5
   260   Those hours that with gentle work did frame
   261   The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
   262   Will play the tyrants to the very same,
   263   And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
   264   For never-resting time leads summer on
   265   To hideous winter and confounds him there,
   266   Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
   267   Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
   268   Then were not summer's distillation left
   269   A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
   270   Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
   271   Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
   272     But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,
   273     Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.
   274 
   275 
   276                      6
   277   Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
   278   In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
   279   Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
   280   With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
   281   That use is not forbidden usury,
   282   Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
   283   That's for thy self to breed another thee,
   284   Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
   285   Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
   286   If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
   287   Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
   288   Leaving thee living in posterity?
   289     Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
   290     To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
   291 
   292 
   293                      7
   294   Lo in the orient when the gracious light
   295   Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
   296   Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
   297   Serving with looks his sacred majesty,
   298   And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
   299   Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
   300   Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
   301   Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
   302   But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
   303   Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
   304   The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
   305   From his low tract and look another way:
   306     So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:
   307     Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
   308 
   309 
   310                      8
   311   Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
   312   Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
   313   Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
   314   Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
   315   If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
   316   By unions married do offend thine ear,
   317   They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
   318   In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:
   319   Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
   320   Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
   321   Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
   322   Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
   323     Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
   324     Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.
   325 
   326 
   327                      9
   328   Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
   329   That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
   330   Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
   331   The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,
   332   The world will be thy widow and still weep,
   333   That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
   334   When every private widow well may keep,
   335   By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
   336   Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
   337   Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
   338   But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
   339   And kept unused the user so destroys it:
   340     No love toward others in that bosom sits
   341     That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
   342 
   343 
   344                      10
   345   For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
   346   Who for thy self art so unprovident.
   347   Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
   348   But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
   349   For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
   350   That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
   351   Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
   352   Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
   353   O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,
   354   Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
   355   Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
   356   Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,
   357     Make thee another self for love of me,
   358     That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
   359 
   360 
   361                      11
   362   As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
   363   In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
   364   And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
   365   Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,
   366   Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
   367   Without this folly, age, and cold decay,
   368   If all were minded so, the times should cease,
   369   And threescore year would make the world away:
   370   Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
   371   Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
   372   Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
   373   Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
   374     She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
   375     Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
   376 
   377 
   378                      12
   379   When I do count the clock that tells the time,
   380   And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
   381   When I behold the violet past prime,
   382   And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:
   383   When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
   384   Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
   385   And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
   386   Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
   387   Then of thy beauty do I question make
   388   That thou among the wastes of time must go,
   389   Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
   390   And die as fast as they see others grow,
   391     And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
   392     Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.
   393 
   394 
   395                      13
   396   O that you were your self, but love you are
   397   No longer yours, than you your self here live,
   398   Against this coming end you should prepare,
   399   And your sweet semblance to some other give.
   400   So should that beauty which you hold in lease
   401   Find no determination, then you were
   402   Your self again after your self's decease,
   403   When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
   404   Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
   405   Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
   406   Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
   407   And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
   408     O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
   409     You had a father, let your son say so.
   410 
   411 
   412                      14
   413   Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
   414   And yet methinks I have astronomy,
   415   But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
   416   Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
   417   Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
   418   Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
   419   Or say with princes if it shall go well
   420   By oft predict that I in heaven find.
   421   But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
   422   And constant stars in them I read such art
   423   As truth and beauty shall together thrive
   424   If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:
   425     Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
   426     Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
   427 
   428 
   429                      15
   430   When I consider every thing that grows
   431   Holds in perfection but a little moment.
   432   That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
   433   Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
   434   When I perceive that men as plants increase,
   435   Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
   436   Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
   437   And wear their brave state out of memory.
   438   Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
   439   Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
   440   Where wasteful time debateth with decay
   441   To change your day of youth to sullied night,
   442     And all in war with Time for love of you,
   443     As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
   444 
   445 
   446                      16
   447   But wherefore do not you a mightier way
   448   Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
   449   And fortify your self in your decay
   450   With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
   451   Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
   452   And many maiden gardens yet unset,
   453   With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
   454   Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
   455   So should the lines of life that life repair
   456   Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
   457   Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
   458   Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
   459     To give away your self, keeps your self still,
   460     And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
   461 
   462 
   463                      17
   464   Who will believe my verse in time to come
   465   If it were filled with your most high deserts?
   466   Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
   467   Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:
   468   If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
   469   And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
   470   The age to come would say this poet lies,
   471   Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
   472   So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
   473   Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
   474   And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
   475   And stretched metre of an antique song.
   476     But were some child of yours alive that time,
   477     You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.
   478 
   479 
   480                      18
   481   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
   482   Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
   483   Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
   484   And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
   485   Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
   486   And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
   487   And every fair from fair sometime declines,
   488   By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:
   489   But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
   490   Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
   491   Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
   492   When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
   493     So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   494     So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
   495 
   496 
   497                      19
   498   Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,
   499   And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
   500   Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
   501   And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
   502   Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
   503   And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
   504   To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
   505   But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,
   506   O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
   507   Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
   508   Him in thy course untainted do allow,
   509   For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
   510     Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
   511     My love shall in my verse ever live young.
   512 
   513 
   514                      20
   515   A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
   516   Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
   517   A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
   518   With shifting change as is false women's fashion,
   519   An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
   520   Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
   521   A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
   522   Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
   523   And for a woman wert thou first created,
   524   Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
   525   And by addition me of thee defeated,
   526   By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
   527     But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
   528     Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
   529 
   530 
   531                      21
   532   So is it not with me as with that muse,
   533   Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
   534   Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
   535   And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
   536   Making a couplement of proud compare
   537   With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
   538   With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
   539   That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
   540   O let me true in love but truly write,
   541   And then believe me, my love is as fair,
   542   As any mother's child, though not so bright
   543   As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
   544     Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
   545     I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
   546 
   547 
   548                      22
   549   My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
   550   So long as youth and thou are of one date,
   551   But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
   552   Then look I death my days should expiate.
   553   For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
   554   Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
   555   Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
   556   How can I then be elder than thou art?
   557   O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
   558   As I not for my self, but for thee will,
   559   Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
   560   As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
   561     Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
   562     Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
   563 
   564 
   565                      23
   566   As an unperfect actor on the stage,
   567   Who with his fear is put beside his part,
   568   Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
   569   Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
   570   So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
   571   The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
   572   And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
   573   O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:
   574   O let my looks be then the eloquence,
   575   And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
   576   Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
   577   More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
   578     O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
   579     To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
   580 
   581 
   582                      24
   583   Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
   584   Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
   585   My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
   586   And perspective it is best painter's art.
   587   For through the painter must you see his skill,
   588   To find where your true image pictured lies,
   589   Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
   590   That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
   591   Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
   592   Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
   593   Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
   594   Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
   595     Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
   596     They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
   597 
   598 
   599                      25
   600   Let those who are in favour with their stars,
   601   Of public honour and proud titles boast,
   602   Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
   603   Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
   604   Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
   605   But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
   606   And in themselves their pride lies buried,
   607   For at a frown they in their glory die.
   608   The painful warrior famoused for fight,
   609   After a thousand victories once foiled,
   610   Is from the book of honour razed quite,
   611   And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
   612     Then happy I that love and am beloved
   613     Where I may not remove nor be removed.
   614 
   615 
   616                      26
   617   Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
   618   Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
   619   To thee I send this written embassage
   620   To witness duty, not to show my wit.
   621   Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
   622   May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
   623   But that I hope some good conceit of thine
   624   In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
   625   Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
   626   Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
   627   And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
   628   To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
   629     Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
   630     Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
   631 
   632 
   633                      27
   634   Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
   635   The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
   636   But then begins a journey in my head
   637   To work my mind, when body's work's expired.
   638   For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
   639   Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
   640   And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
   641   Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
   642   Save that my soul's imaginary sight
   643   Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
   644   Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
   645   Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
   646     Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
   647     For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
   648 
   649 
   650                      28
   651   How can I then return in happy plight
   652   That am debarred the benefit of rest?
   653   When day's oppression is not eased by night,
   654   But day by night and night by day oppressed.
   655   And each (though enemies to either's reign)
   656   Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
   657   The one by toil, the other to complain
   658   How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
   659   I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
   660   And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
   661   So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
   662   When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
   663     But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
   664     And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
   665 
   666 
   667                      29
   668   When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,
   669   I all alone beweep my outcast state,
   670   And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
   671   And look upon my self and curse my fate,
   672   Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
   673   Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
   674   Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
   675   With what I most enjoy contented least,
   676   Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
   677   Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
   678   (Like to the lark at break of day arising
   679   From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,
   680     For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
   681     That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
   682 
   683 
   684                      30
   685   When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
   686   I summon up remembrance of things past,
   687   I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
   688   And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
   689   Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
   690   For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
   691   And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
   692   And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
   693   Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
   694   And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
   695   The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
   696   Which I new pay as if not paid before.
   697     But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
   698     All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
   699 
   700 
   701                      31
   702   Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
   703   Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
   704   And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
   705   And all those friends which I thought buried.
   706   How many a holy and obsequious tear
   707   Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
   708   As interest of the dead, which now appear,
   709   But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
   710   Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
   711   Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
   712   Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
   713   That due of many, now is thine alone.
   714     Their images I loved, I view in thee,
   715     And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
   716 
   717 
   718                      32
   719   If thou survive my well-contented day,
   720   When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
   721   And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
   722   These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:
   723   Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
   724   And though they be outstripped by every pen,
   725   Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
   726   Exceeded by the height of happier men.
   727   O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
   728   'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
   729   A dearer birth than this his love had brought
   730   To march in ranks of better equipage:
   731     But since he died and poets better prove,
   732     Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
   733 
   734 
   735                      33
   736   Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
   737   Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
   738   Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
   739   Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
   740   Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
   741   With ugly rack on his celestial face,
   742   And from the forlorn world his visage hide
   743   Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
   744   Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
   745   With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
   746   But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
   747   The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
   748     Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
   749     Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.
   750 
   751 
   752                      34
   753   Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
   754   And make me travel forth without my cloak,
   755   To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
   756   Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
   757   'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
   758   To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
   759   For no man well of such a salve can speak,
   760   That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
   761   Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
   762   Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,
   763   Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
   764   To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
   765     Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
   766     And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
   767 
   768 
   769                      35
   770   No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
   771   Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
   772   Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
   773   And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
   774   All men make faults, and even I in this,
   775   Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
   776   My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
   777   Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
   778   For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
   779   Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
   780   And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
   781   Such civil war is in my love and hate,
   782     That I an accessary needs must be,
   783     To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
   784 
   785 
   786                      36
   787   Let me confess that we two must be twain,
   788   Although our undivided loves are one:
   789   So shall those blots that do with me remain,
   790   Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
   791   In our two loves there is but one respect,
   792   Though in our lives a separable spite,
   793   Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
   794   Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
   795   I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
   796   Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
   797   Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
   798   Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
   799     But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
   800     As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
   801 
   802 
   803                      37
   804   As a decrepit father takes delight,
   805   To see his active child do deeds of youth,
   806   So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
   807   Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
   808   For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
   809   Or any of these all, or all, or more
   810   Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
   811   I make my love engrafted to this store:
   812   So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
   813   Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
   814   That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
   815   And by a part of all thy glory live:
   816     Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
   817     This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
   818 
   819 
   820                      38
   821   How can my muse want subject to invent
   822   While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,
   823   Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
   824   For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
   825   O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
   826   Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
   827   For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
   828   When thou thy self dost give invention light?
   829   Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
   830   Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
   831   And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
   832   Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
   833     If my slight muse do please these curious days,
   834     The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
   835 
   836 
   837                      39
   838   O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
   839   When thou art all the better part of me?
   840   What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
   841   And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
   842   Even for this, let us divided live,
   843   And our dear love lose name of single one,
   844   That by this separation I may give:
   845   That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:
   846   O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,
   847   Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
   848   To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
   849   Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.
   850     And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
   851     By praising him here who doth hence remain.
   852 
   853 
   854                      40
   855   Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
   856   What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
   857   No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
   858   All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
   859   Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
   860   I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
   861   But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
   862   By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
   863   I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
   864   Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
   865   And yet love knows it is a greater grief
   866   To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
   867     Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
   868     Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
   869 
   870 
   871                      41
   872   Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
   873   When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
   874   Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
   875   For still temptation follows where thou art.
   876   Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
   877   Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
   878   And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
   879   Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
   880   Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
   881   And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
   882   Who lead thee in their riot even there
   883   Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
   884     Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
   885     Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
   886 
   887 
   888                      42
   889   That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
   890   And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
   891   That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
   892   A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
   893   Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
   894   Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
   895   And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
   896   Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
   897   If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
   898   And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
   899   Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
   900   And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
   901     But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
   902     Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
   903 
   904 
   905                      43
   906   When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
   907   For all the day they view things unrespected,
   908   But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
   909   And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
   910   Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
   911   How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,
   912   To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
   913   When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
   914   How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
   915   By looking on thee in the living day,
   916   When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
   917   Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
   918     All days are nights to see till I see thee,
   919     And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
   920 
   921 
   922                      44
   923   If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
   924   Injurious distance should not stop my way,
   925   For then despite of space I would be brought,
   926   From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
   927   No matter then although my foot did stand
   928   Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
   929   For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
   930   As soon as think the place where he would be.
   931   But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
   932   To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
   933   But that so much of earth and water wrought,
   934   I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.
   935     Receiving nought by elements so slow,
   936     But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
   937 
   938 
   939                      45
   940   The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
   941   Are both with thee, wherever I abide,
   942   The first my thought, the other my desire,
   943   These present-absent with swift motion slide.
   944   For when these quicker elements are gone
   945   In tender embassy of love to thee,
   946   My life being made of four, with two alone,
   947   Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
   948   Until life's composition be recured,
   949   By those swift messengers returned from thee,
   950   Who even but now come back again assured,
   951   Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
   952     This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,
   953     I send them back again and straight grow sad.
   954 
   955 
   956                      46
   957   Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
   958   How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
   959   Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
   960   My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
   961   My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
   962   (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
   963   But the defendant doth that plea deny,
   964   And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
   965   To side this title is impanelled
   966   A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
   967   And by their verdict is determined
   968   The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.
   969     As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,
   970     And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
   971 
   972 
   973                      47
   974   Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
   975   And each doth good turns now unto the other,
   976   When that mine eye is famished for a look,
   977   Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;
   978   With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
   979   And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
   980   Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
   981   And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
   982   So either by thy picture or my love,
   983   Thy self away, art present still with me,
   984   For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
   985   And I am still with them, and they with thee.
   986     Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
   987     Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.
   988 
   989 
   990                      48
   991   How careful was I when I took my way,
   992   Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
   993   That to my use it might unused stay
   994   From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
   995   But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
   996   Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
   997   Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
   998   Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
   999   Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
  1000   Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
  1001   Within the gentle closure of my breast,
  1002   From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
  1003     And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
  1004     For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
  1005 
  1006 
  1007                      49
  1008   Against that time (if ever that time come)
  1009   When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
  1010   When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  1011   Called to that audit by advised respects,
  1012   Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  1013   And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
  1014   When love converted from the thing it was
  1015   Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
  1016   Against that time do I ensconce me here
  1017   Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  1018   And this my hand, against my self uprear,
  1019   To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,
  1020     To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
  1021     Since why to love, I can allege no cause.
  1022 
  1023 
  1024                      50
  1025   How heavy do I journey on the way,
  1026   When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
  1027   Doth teach that case and that repose to say
  1028   'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
  1029   The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
  1030   Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
  1031   As if by some instinct the wretch did know
  1032   His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
  1033   The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
  1034   That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  1035   Which heavily he answers with a groan,
  1036   More sharp to me than spurring to his side,
  1037     For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
  1038     My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
  1039 
  1040 
  1041                      51
  1042   Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
  1043   Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,
  1044   From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
  1045   Till I return of posting is no need.
  1046   O what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  1047   When swift extremity can seem but slow?
  1048   Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,
  1049   In winged speed no motion shall I know,
  1050   Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
  1051   Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
  1052   Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
  1053   But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
  1054     Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
  1055     Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
  1056 
  1057 
  1058                      52
  1059   So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
  1060   Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  1061   The which he will not every hour survey,
  1062   For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
  1063   Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
  1064   Since seldom coming in that long year set,
  1065   Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
  1066   Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
  1067   So is the time that keeps you as my chest
  1068   Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  1069   To make some special instant special-blest,
  1070   By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
  1071     Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
  1072     Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.
  1073 
  1074 
  1075                      53
  1076   What is your substance, whereof are you made,
  1077   That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
  1078   Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
  1079   And you but one, can every shadow lend:
  1080   Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
  1081   Is poorly imitated after you,
  1082   On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
  1083   And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
  1084   Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
  1085   The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
  1086   The other as your bounty doth appear,
  1087   And you in every blessed shape we know.
  1088     In all external grace you have some part,
  1089     But you like none, none you for constant heart.
  1090 
  1091 
  1092                      54
  1093   O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
  1094   By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
  1095   The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  1096   For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
  1097   The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
  1098   As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
  1099   Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
  1100   When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  1101   But for their virtue only is their show,
  1102   They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
  1103   Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
  1104   Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
  1105     And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
  1106     When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
  1107 
  1108 
  1109                      55
  1110   Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
  1111   Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
  1112   But you shall shine more bright in these contents
  1113   Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
  1114   When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
  1115   And broils root out the work of masonry,
  1116   Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:
  1117   The living record of your memory.
  1118   'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
  1119   Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,
  1120   Even in the eyes of all posterity
  1121   That wear this world out to the ending doom.
  1122     So till the judgment that your self arise,
  1123     You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
  1124 
  1125 
  1126                      56
  1127   Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
  1128   Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
  1129   Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
  1130   To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
  1131   So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
  1132   Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
  1133   To-morrow see again, and do not kill
  1134   The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
  1135   Let this sad interim like the ocean be
  1136   Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
  1137   Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
  1138   Return of love, more blest may be the view.
  1139     Or call it winter, which being full of care,
  1140     Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
  1141 
  1142 
  1143                      57
  1144   Being your slave what should I do but tend,
  1145   Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
  1146   I have no precious time at all to spend;
  1147   Nor services to do till you require.
  1148   Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
  1149   Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
  1150   Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
  1151   When you have bid your servant once adieu.
  1152   Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
  1153   Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  1154   But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
  1155   Save where you are, how happy you make those.
  1156     So true a fool is love, that in your will,
  1157     (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
  1158 
  1159 
  1160                      58
  1161   That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
  1162   I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
  1163   Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
  1164   Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
  1165   O let me suffer (being at your beck)
  1166   Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,
  1167   And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
  1168   Without accusing you of injury.
  1169   Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
  1170   That you your self may privilage your time
  1171   To what you will, to you it doth belong,
  1172   Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
  1173     I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
  1174     Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
  1175 
  1176 
  1177                      59
  1178   If there be nothing new, but that which is,
  1179   Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
  1180   Which labouring for invention bear amis
  1181   The second burthen of a former child!
  1182   O that record could with a backward look,
  1183   Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
  1184   Show me your image in some antique book,
  1185   Since mind at first in character was done.
  1186   That I might see what the old world could say,
  1187   To this composed wonder of your frame,
  1188   Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
  1189   Or whether revolution be the same.
  1190     O sure I am the wits of former days,
  1191     To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
  1192 
  1193 
  1194                      60
  1195   Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
  1196   So do our minutes hasten to their end,
  1197   Each changing place with that which goes before,
  1198   In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  1199   Nativity once in the main of light,
  1200   Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,
  1201   Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
  1202   And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
  1203   Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
  1204   And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
  1205   Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  1206   And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
  1207     And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
  1208     Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
  1209 
  1210 
  1211                      61
  1212   Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
  1213   My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
  1214   Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
  1215   While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
  1216   Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
  1217   So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  1218   To find out shames and idle hours in me,
  1219   The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
  1220   O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
  1221   It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
  1222   Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  1223   To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
  1224     For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
  1225     From me far off, with others all too near.
  1226 
  1227 
  1228                      62
  1229   Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
  1230   And all my soul, and all my every part;
  1231   And for this sin there is no remedy,
  1232   It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  1233   Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  1234   No shape so true, no truth of such account,
  1235   And for my self mine own worth do define,
  1236   As I all other in all worths surmount.
  1237   But when my glass shows me my self indeed
  1238   beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
  1239   Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
  1240   Self, so self-loving were iniquity.
  1241     'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
  1242     Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
  1243 
  1244 
  1245                      63
  1246   Against my love shall be as I am now
  1247   With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
  1248   When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
  1249   With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
  1250   Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
  1251   And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  1252   Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  1253   Stealing away the treasure of his spring:
  1254   For such a time do I now fortify
  1255   Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  1256   That he shall never cut from memory
  1257   My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
  1258     His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
  1259     And they shall live, and he in them still green.
  1260 
  1261 
  1262                      64
  1263   When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
  1264   The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,
  1265   When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
  1266   And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
  1267   When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
  1268   Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  1269   And the firm soil win of the watery main,
  1270   Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
  1271   When I have seen such interchange of State,
  1272   Or state it self confounded, to decay,
  1273   Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
  1274   That Time will come and take my love away.
  1275     This thought is as a death which cannot choose
  1276     But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
  1277 
  1278 
  1279                      65
  1280   Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
  1281   But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
  1282   How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
  1283   Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
  1284   O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
  1285   Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,
  1286   When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  1287   Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
  1288   O fearful meditation, where alack,
  1289   Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  1290   Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
  1291   Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
  1292     O none, unless this miracle have might,
  1293     That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
  1294 
  1295 
  1296                      66
  1297   Tired with all these for restful death I cry,
  1298   As to behold desert a beggar born,
  1299   And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
  1300   And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  1301   And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
  1302   And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  1303   And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
  1304   And strength by limping sway disabled
  1305   And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  1306   And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
  1307   And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
  1308   And captive good attending captain ill.
  1309     Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
  1310     Save that to die, I leave my love alone.
  1311 
  1312 
  1313                      67
  1314   Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
  1315   And with his presence grace impiety,
  1316   That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  1317   And lace it self with his society?
  1318   Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  1319   And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
  1320   Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
  1321   Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  1322   Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
  1323   Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
  1324   For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  1325   And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
  1326     O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
  1327     In days long since, before these last so bad.
  1328 
  1329 
  1330                      68
  1331   Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  1332   When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  1333   Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  1334   Or durst inhabit on a living brow:
  1335   Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  1336   The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  1337   To live a second life on second head,
  1338   Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  1339   In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  1340   Without all ornament, it self and true,
  1341   Making no summer of another's green,
  1342   Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,
  1343     And him as for a map doth Nature store,
  1344     To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
  1345 
  1346 
  1347                      69
  1348   Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,
  1349   Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
  1350   All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
  1351   Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
  1352   Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
  1353   But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
  1354   In other accents do this praise confound
  1355   By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
  1356   They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  1357   And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
  1358   Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
  1359   To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
  1360     But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
  1361     The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
  1362 
  1363 
  1364                      70
  1365   That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
  1366   For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,
  1367   The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  1368   A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  1369   So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
  1370   Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
  1371   For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  1372   And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  1373   Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
  1374   Either not assailed, or victor being charged,
  1375   Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  1376   To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,
  1377     If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,
  1378     Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
  1379 
  1380 
  1381                      71
  1382   No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
  1383   Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  1384   Give warning to the world that I am fled
  1385   From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  1386   Nay if you read this line, remember not,
  1387   The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  1388   That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  1389   If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  1390   O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
  1391   When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
  1392   Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  1393   But let your love even with my life decay.
  1394     Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
  1395     And mock you with me after I am gone.
  1396 
  1397 
  1398                      72
  1399   O lest the world should task you to recite,
  1400   What merit lived in me that you should love
  1401   After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
  1402   For you in me can nothing worthy prove.
  1403   Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
  1404   To do more for me than mine own desert,
  1405   And hang more praise upon deceased I,
  1406   Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
  1407   O lest your true love may seem false in this,
  1408   That you for love speak well of me untrue,
  1409   My name be buried where my body is,
  1410   And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
  1411     For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
  1412     And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
  1413 
  1414 
  1415                      73
  1416   That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
  1417   When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
  1418   Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  1419   Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  1420   In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
  1421   As after sunset fadeth in the west,
  1422   Which by and by black night doth take away,
  1423   Death's second self that seals up all in rest.
  1424   In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
  1425   That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  1426   As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
  1427   Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
  1428     This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
  1429     To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
  1430 
  1431 
  1432                      74
  1433   But be contented when that fell arrest,
  1434   Without all bail shall carry me away,
  1435   My life hath in this line some interest,
  1436   Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
  1437   When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
  1438   The very part was consecrate to thee,
  1439   The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
  1440   My spirit is thine the better part of me,
  1441   So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  1442   The prey of worms, my body being dead,
  1443   The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
  1444   Too base of thee to be remembered,
  1445     The worth of that, is that which it contains,
  1446     And that is this, and this with thee remains.
  1447 
  1448 
  1449                      75
  1450   So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
  1451   Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
  1452   And for the peace of you I hold such strife
  1453   As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
  1454   Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
  1455   Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
  1456   Now counting best to be with you alone,
  1457   Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
  1458   Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  1459   And by and by clean starved for a look,
  1460   Possessing or pursuing no delight
  1461   Save what is had, or must from you be took.
  1462     Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
  1463     Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
  1464 
  1465 
  1466                      76
  1467   Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
  1468   So far from variation or quick change?
  1469   Why with the time do I not glance aside
  1470   To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
  1471   Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  1472   And keep invention in a noted weed,
  1473   That every word doth almost tell my name,
  1474   Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
  1475   O know sweet love I always write of you,
  1476   And you and love are still my argument:
  1477   So all my best is dressing old words new,
  1478   Spending again what is already spent:
  1479     For as the sun is daily new and old,
  1480     So is my love still telling what is told.
  1481 
  1482 
  1483                      77
  1484   Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  1485   Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
  1486   These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
  1487   And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
  1488   The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
  1489   Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
  1490   Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
  1491   Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  1492   Look what thy memory cannot contain,
  1493   Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  1494   Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
  1495   To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
  1496     These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
  1497     Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
  1498 
  1499 
  1500                      78
  1501   So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
  1502   And found such fair assistance in my verse,
  1503   As every alien pen hath got my use,
  1504   And under thee their poesy disperse.
  1505   Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
  1506   And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
  1507   Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
  1508   And given grace a double majesty.
  1509   Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
  1510   Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
  1511   In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
  1512   And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
  1513     But thou art all my art, and dost advance
  1514     As high as learning, my rude ignorance.
  1515 
  1516 
  1517                      79
  1518   Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  1519   My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
  1520   But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
  1521   And my sick muse doth give an other place.
  1522   I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
  1523   Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
  1524   Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
  1525   He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
  1526   He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
  1527   From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
  1528   And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
  1529   No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
  1530     Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
  1531     Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.
  1532 
  1533 
  1534                      80
  1535   O how I faint when I of you do write,
  1536   Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
  1537   And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
  1538   To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
  1539   But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
  1540   The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
  1541   My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
  1542   On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  1543   Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
  1544   Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
  1545   Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
  1546   He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
  1547     Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
  1548     The worst was this, my love was my decay.
  1549 
  1550 
  1551                      81
  1552   Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  1553   Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
  1554   From hence your memory death cannot take,
  1555   Although in me each part will be forgotten.
  1556   Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
  1557   Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,
  1558   The earth can yield me but a common grave,
  1559   When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,
  1560   Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  1561   Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
  1562   And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
  1563   When all the breathers of this world are dead,
  1564     You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
  1565     Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
  1566 
  1567 
  1568                      82
  1569   I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
  1570   And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
  1571   The dedicated words which writers use
  1572   Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
  1573   Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
  1574   Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
  1575   And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
  1576   Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  1577   And do so love, yet when they have devised,
  1578   What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  1579   Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
  1580   In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
  1581     And their gross painting might be better used,
  1582     Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
  1583 
  1584 
  1585                      83
  1586   I never saw that you did painting need,
  1587   And therefore to your fair no painting set,
  1588   I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
  1589   That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  1590   And therefore have I slept in your report,
  1591   That you your self being extant well might show,
  1592   How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  1593   Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  1594   This silence for my sin you did impute,
  1595   Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
  1596   For I impair not beauty being mute,
  1597   When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
  1598     There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
  1599     Than both your poets can in praise devise.
  1600 
  1601 
  1602                      84
  1603   Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  1604   Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
  1605   In whose confine immured is the store,
  1606   Which should example where your equal grew.
  1607   Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
  1608   That to his subject lends not some small glory,
  1609   But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
  1610   That you are you, so dignifies his story.
  1611   Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  1612   Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  1613   And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
  1614   Making his style admired every where.
  1615     You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
  1616     Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
  1617 
  1618 
  1619                      85
  1620   My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
  1621   While comments of your praise richly compiled,
  1622   Reserve their character with golden quill,
  1623   And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
  1624   I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
  1625   And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
  1626   To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  1627   In polished form of well refined pen.
  1628   Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
  1629   And to the most of praise add something more,
  1630   But that is in my thought, whose love to you
  1631   (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
  1632     Then others, for the breath of words respect,
  1633     Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
  1634 
  1635 
  1636                      86
  1637   Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  1638   Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
  1639   That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  1640   Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  1641   Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  1642   Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  1643   No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  1644   Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  1645   He nor that affable familiar ghost
  1646   Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  1647   As victors of my silence cannot boast,
  1648   I was not sick of any fear from thence.
  1649     But when your countenance filled up his line,
  1650     Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.
  1651 
  1652 
  1653                      87
  1654   Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  1655   And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  1656   The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
  1657   My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  1658   For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
  1659   And for that riches where is my deserving?
  1660   The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  1661   And so my patent back again is swerving.
  1662   Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  1663   Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
  1664   So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
  1665   Comes home again, on better judgement making.
  1666     Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
  1667     In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
  1668 
  1669 
  1670                      88
  1671   When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
  1672   And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  1673   Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
  1674   And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
  1675   With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
  1676   Upon thy part I can set down a story
  1677   Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
  1678   That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:
  1679   And I by this will be a gainer too,
  1680   For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  1681   The injuries that to my self I do,
  1682   Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
  1683     Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
  1684     That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
  1685 
  1686 
  1687                      89
  1688   Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  1689   And I will comment upon that offence,
  1690   Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
  1691   Against thy reasons making no defence.
  1692   Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
  1693   To set a form upon desired change,
  1694   As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
  1695   I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
  1696   Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
  1697   Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  1698   Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
  1699   And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
  1700     For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
  1701     For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
  1702 
  1703 
  1704                      90
  1705   Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
  1706   Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  1707   join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  1708   And do not drop in for an after-loss:
  1709   Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
  1710   Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
  1711   Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
  1712   To linger out a purposed overthrow.
  1713   If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  1714   When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  1715   But in the onset come, so shall I taste
  1716   At first the very worst of fortune's might.
  1717     And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
  1718     Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
  1719 
  1720 
  1721                      91
  1722   Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  1723   Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
  1724   Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
  1725   Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
  1726   And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
  1727   Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
  1728   But these particulars are not my measure,
  1729   All these I better in one general best.
  1730   Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  1731   Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
  1732   Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
  1733   And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
  1734     Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
  1735     All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
  1736 
  1737 
  1738                      92
  1739   But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
  1740   For term of life thou art assured mine,
  1741   And life no longer than thy love will stay,
  1742   For it depends upon that love of thine.
  1743   Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
  1744   When in the least of them my life hath end,
  1745   I see, a better state to me belongs
  1746   Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
  1747   Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
  1748   Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
  1749   O what a happy title do I find,
  1750   Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
  1751     But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
  1752     Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
  1753 
  1754 
  1755                      93
  1756   So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
  1757   Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
  1758   May still seem love to me, though altered new:
  1759   Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
  1760   For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
  1761   Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
  1762   In many's looks, the false heart's history
  1763   Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
  1764   But heaven in thy creation did decree,
  1765   That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
  1766   Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
  1767   Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
  1768     How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
  1769     If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
  1770 
  1771 
  1772                      94
  1773   They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
  1774   That do not do the thing, they most do show,
  1775   Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
  1776   Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
  1777   They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
  1778   And husband nature's riches from expense,
  1779   Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
  1780   Others, but stewards of their excellence:
  1781   The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
  1782   Though to it self, it only live and die,
  1783   But if that flower with base infection meet,
  1784   The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
  1785     For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
  1786     Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
  1787 
  1788 
  1789                      95
  1790   How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
  1791   Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,
  1792   Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
  1793   O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
  1794   That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  1795   (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
  1796   Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
  1797   Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
  1798   O what a mansion have those vices got,
  1799   Which for their habitation chose out thee,
  1800   Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
  1801   And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
  1802     Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
  1803     The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
  1804 
  1805 
  1806                      96
  1807   Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
  1808   Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
  1809   Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
  1810   Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
  1811   As on the finger of a throned queen,
  1812   The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
  1813   So are those errors that in thee are seen,
  1814   To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
  1815   How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  1816   If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
  1817   How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  1818   if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
  1819     But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
  1820     As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
  1821 
  1822 
  1823                      97
  1824   How like a winter hath my absence been
  1825   From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
  1826   What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  1827   What old December's bareness everywhere!
  1828   And yet this time removed was summer's time,
  1829   The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
  1830   Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  1831   Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
  1832   Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
  1833   But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
  1834   For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  1835   And thou away, the very birds are mute.
  1836     Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
  1837     That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
  1838 
  1839 
  1840                      98
  1841   From you have I been absent in the spring,
  1842   When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
  1843   Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
  1844   That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
  1845   Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  1846   Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  1847   Could make me any summer's story tell:
  1848   Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
  1849   Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
  1850   Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
  1851   They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
  1852   Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  1853     Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
  1854     As with your shadow I with these did play.
  1855 
  1856 
  1857                      99
  1858   The forward violet thus did I chide,
  1859   Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  1860   If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
  1861   Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
  1862   In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
  1863   The lily I condemned for thy hand,
  1864   And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
  1865   The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  1866   One blushing shame, another white despair:
  1867   A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
  1868   And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
  1869   But for his theft in pride of all his growth
  1870   A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
  1871     More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
  1872     But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.
  1873 
  1874 
  1875                      100
  1876   Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
  1877   To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
  1878   Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
  1879   Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
  1880   Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
  1881   In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
  1882   Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
  1883   And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
  1884   Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
  1885   If time have any wrinkle graven there,
  1886   If any, be a satire to decay,
  1887   And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
  1888     Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
  1889     So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.
  1890 
  1891 
  1892                      101
  1893   O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
  1894   For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
  1895   Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
  1896   So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
  1897   Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
  1898   'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
  1899   Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
  1900   But best is best, if never intermixed'?
  1901   Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  1902   Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
  1903   To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
  1904   And to be praised of ages yet to be.
  1905     Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
  1906     To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
  1907 
  1908 
  1909                      102
  1910   My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
  1911   I love not less, though less the show appear,
  1912   That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,
  1913   The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
  1914   Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  1915   When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
  1916   As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
  1917   And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  1918   Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  1919   Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
  1920   But that wild music burthens every bough,
  1921   And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
  1922     Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
  1923     Because I would not dull you with my song.
  1924 
  1925 
  1926                      103
  1927   Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
  1928   That having such a scope to show her pride,
  1929   The argument all bare is of more worth
  1930   Than when it hath my added praise beside.
  1931   O blame me not if I no more can write!
  1932   Look in your glass and there appears a face,
  1933   That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
  1934   Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
  1935   Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
  1936   To mar the subject that before was well?
  1937   For to no other pass my verses tend,
  1938   Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
  1939     And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
  1940     Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.
  1941 
  1942 
  1943                      104
  1944   To me fair friend you never can be old,
  1945   For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
  1946   Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
  1947   Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  1948   Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
  1949   In process of the seasons have I seen,
  1950   Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
  1951   Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.
  1952   Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
  1953   Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
  1954   So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand
  1955   Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
  1956     For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,
  1957     Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
  1958 
  1959 
  1960                      105
  1961   Let not my love be called idolatry,
  1962   Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  1963   Since all alike my songs and praises be
  1964   To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
  1965   Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  1966   Still constant in a wondrous excellence,
  1967   Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  1968   One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
  1969   Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
  1970   Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,
  1971   And in this change is my invention spent,
  1972   Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
  1973     Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
  1974     Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
  1975 
  1976 
  1977                      106
  1978   When in the chronicle of wasted time,
  1979   I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  1980   And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
  1981   In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
  1982   Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
  1983   Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  1984   I see their antique pen would have expressed,
  1985   Even such a beauty as you master now.
  1986   So all their praises are but prophecies
  1987   Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
  1988   And for they looked but with divining eyes,
  1989   They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
  1990     For we which now behold these present days,
  1991     Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
  1992 
  1993 
  1994                      107
  1995   Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
  1996   Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
  1997   Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  1998   Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  1999   The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
  2000   And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
  2001   Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
  2002   And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
  2003   Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
  2004   My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
  2005   Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  2006   While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.
  2007     And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
  2008     When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
  2009 
  2010 
  2011                      108
  2012   What's in the brain that ink may character,
  2013   Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,
  2014   What's new to speak, what now to register,
  2015   That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
  2016   Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
  2017   I must each day say o'er the very same,
  2018   Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  2019   Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
  2020   So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
  2021   Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  2022   Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  2023   But makes antiquity for aye his page,
  2024     Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
  2025     Where time and outward form would show it dead.
  2026 
  2027 
  2028                      109
  2029   O never say that I was false of heart,
  2030   Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
  2031   As easy might I from my self depart,
  2032   As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
  2033   That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
  2034   Like him that travels I return again,
  2035   Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  2036   So that my self bring water for my stain,
  2037   Never believe though in my nature reigned,
  2038   All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
  2039   That it could so preposterously be stained,
  2040   To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:
  2041     For nothing this wide universe I call,
  2042     Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.
  2043 
  2044 
  2045                      110
  2046   Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
  2047   And made my self a motley to the view,
  2048   Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  2049   Made old offences of affections new.
  2050   Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
  2051   Askance and strangely: but by all above,
  2052   These blenches gave my heart another youth,
  2053   And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
  2054   Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
  2055   Mine appetite I never more will grind
  2056   On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  2057   A god in love, to whom I am confined.
  2058     Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
  2059     Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
  2060 
  2061 
  2062                      111
  2063   O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  2064   The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
  2065   That did not better for my life provide,
  2066   Than public means which public manners breeds.
  2067   Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
  2068   And almost thence my nature is subdued
  2069   To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
  2070   Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,
  2071   Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,
  2072   Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,
  2073   No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  2074   Nor double penance to correct correction.
  2075     Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,
  2076     Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
  2077 
  2078 
  2079                      112
  2080   Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
  2081   Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
  2082   For what care I who calls me well or ill,
  2083   So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
  2084   You are my all the world, and I must strive,
  2085   To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
  2086   None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  2087   That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
  2088   In so profound abysm I throw all care
  2089   Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,
  2090   To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
  2091   Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
  2092     You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
  2093     That all the world besides methinks are dead.
  2094 
  2095 
  2096                      113
  2097   Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
  2098   And that which governs me to go about,
  2099   Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
  2100   Seems seeing, but effectually is out:
  2101   For it no form delivers to the heart
  2102   Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
  2103   Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  2104   Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  2105   For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
  2106   The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
  2107   The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
  2108   The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
  2109     Incapable of more, replete with you,
  2110     My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
  2111 
  2112 
  2113                      114
  2114   Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
  2115   Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
  2116   Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
  2117   And that your love taught it this alchemy?
  2118   To make of monsters, and things indigest,
  2119   Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
  2120   Creating every bad a perfect best
  2121   As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
  2122   O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
  2123   And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
  2124   Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
  2125   And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
  2126     If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,
  2127     That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
  2128 
  2129 
  2130                      115
  2131   Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
  2132   Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
  2133   Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
  2134   My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
  2135   But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
  2136   Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
  2137   Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  2138   Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
  2139   Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
  2140   Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
  2141   When I was certain o'er incertainty,
  2142   Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
  2143     Love is a babe, then might I not say so
  2144     To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
  2145 
  2146 
  2147                      116
  2148   Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  2149   Admit impediments, love is not love
  2150   Which alters when it alteration finds,
  2151   Or bends with the remover to remove.
  2152   O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
  2153   That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  2154   It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
  2155   Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
  2156   Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  2157   Within his bending sickle's compass come,
  2158   Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  2159   But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
  2160     If this be error and upon me proved,
  2161     I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
  2162 
  2163 
  2164                      117
  2165   Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
  2166   Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
  2167   Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
  2168   Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
  2169   That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
  2170   And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
  2171   That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  2172   Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
  2173   Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
  2174   And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
  2175   Bring me within the level of your frown,
  2176   But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
  2177     Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
  2178     The constancy and virtue of your love.
  2179 
  2180 
  2181                      118
  2182   Like as to make our appetite more keen
  2183   With eager compounds we our palate urge,
  2184   As to prevent our maladies unseen,
  2185   We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
  2186   Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  2187   To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  2188   And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,
  2189   To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
  2190   Thus policy in love t' anticipate
  2191   The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
  2192   And brought to medicine a healthful state
  2193   Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
  2194     But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
  2195     Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.
  2196 
  2197 
  2198                      119
  2199   What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
  2200   Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
  2201   Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
  2202   Still losing when I saw my self to win!
  2203   What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
  2204   Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
  2205   How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
  2206   In the distraction of this madding fever!
  2207   O benefit of ill, now I find true
  2208   That better is, by evil still made better.
  2209   And ruined love when it is built anew
  2210   Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
  2211     So I return rebuked to my content,
  2212     And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
  2213 
  2214 
  2215                      120
  2216   That you were once unkind befriends me now,
  2217   And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
  2218   Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  2219   Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
  2220   For if you were by my unkindness shaken
  2221   As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,
  2222   And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
  2223   To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
  2224   O that our night of woe might have remembered
  2225   My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  2226   And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
  2227   The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
  2228     But that your trespass now becomes a fee,
  2229     Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
  2230 
  2231 
  2232                      121
  2233   'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
  2234   When not to be, receives reproach of being,
  2235   And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
  2236   Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.
  2237   For why should others' false adulterate eyes
  2238   Give salutation to my sportive blood?
  2239   Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  2240   Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
  2241   No, I am that I am, and they that level
  2242   At my abuses, reckon up their own,
  2243   I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
  2244   By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
  2245     Unless this general evil they maintain,
  2246     All men are bad and in their badness reign.
  2247 
  2248 
  2249                      122
  2250   Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  2251   Full charactered with lasting memory,
  2252   Which shall above that idle rank remain
  2253   Beyond all date even to eternity.
  2254   Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
  2255   Have faculty by nature to subsist,
  2256   Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
  2257   Of thee, thy record never can be missed:
  2258   That poor retention could not so much hold,
  2259   Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
  2260   Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
  2261   To trust those tables that receive thee more:
  2262     To keep an adjunct to remember thee
  2263     Were to import forgetfulness in me.
  2264 
  2265 
  2266                      123
  2267   No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
  2268   Thy pyramids built up with newer might
  2269   To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
  2270   They are but dressings Of a former sight:
  2271   Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
  2272   What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
  2273   And rather make them born to our desire,
  2274   Than think that we before have heard them told:
  2275   Thy registers and thee I both defy,
  2276   Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
  2277   For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
  2278   Made more or less by thy continual haste:
  2279     This I do vow and this shall ever be,
  2280     I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
  2281 
  2282 
  2283                      124
  2284   If my dear love were but the child of state,
  2285   It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,
  2286   As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
  2287   Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
  2288   No it was builded far from accident,
  2289   It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  2290   Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  2291   Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
  2292   It fears not policy that heretic,
  2293   Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
  2294   But all alone stands hugely politic,
  2295   That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
  2296     To this I witness call the fools of time,
  2297     Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
  2298 
  2299 
  2300                      125
  2301   Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
  2302   With my extern the outward honouring,
  2303   Or laid great bases for eternity,
  2304   Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
  2305   Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
  2306   Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
  2307   For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  2308   Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
  2309   No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  2310   And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  2311   Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
  2312   But mutual render, only me for thee.
  2313     Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
  2314     When most impeached, stands least in thy control.
  2315 
  2316 
  2317                      126
  2318   O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
  2319   Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
  2320   Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,
  2321   Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
  2322   If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
  2323   As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
  2324   She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  2325   May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
  2326   Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
  2327   She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
  2328     Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
  2329     And her quietus is to render thee.
  2330 
  2331 
  2332                      127
  2333   In the old age black was not counted fair,
  2334   Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:
  2335   But now is black beauty's successive heir,
  2336   And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
  2337   For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
  2338   Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,
  2339   Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
  2340   But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
  2341   Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
  2342   Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
  2343   At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
  2344   Slandering creation with a false esteem,
  2345     Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
  2346     That every tongue says beauty should look so.
  2347 
  2348 
  2349                      128
  2350   How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
  2351   Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
  2352   With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
  2353   The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  2354   Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
  2355   To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
  2356   Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
  2357   At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
  2358   To be so tickled they would change their state
  2359   And situation with those dancing chips,
  2360   O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
  2361   Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
  2362     Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
  2363     Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  2364 
  2365 
  2366                      129
  2367   Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
  2368   Is lust in action, and till action, lust
  2369   Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
  2370   Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
  2371   Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
  2372   Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
  2373   Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
  2374   On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
  2375   Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
  2376   Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
  2377   A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
  2378   Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
  2379     All this the world well knows yet none knows well,
  2380     To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
  2381 
  2382 
  2383                      130
  2384   My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
  2385   Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
  2386   If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
  2387   If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
  2388   I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
  2389   But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
  2390   And in some perfumes is there more delight,
  2391   Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  2392   I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
  2393   That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
  2394   I grant I never saw a goddess go,
  2395   My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
  2396     And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
  2397     As any she belied with false compare.
  2398 
  2399 
  2400                      131
  2401   Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
  2402   As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
  2403   For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
  2404   Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
  2405   Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
  2406   Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
  2407   To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
  2408   Although I swear it to my self alone.
  2409   And to be sure that is not false I swear,
  2410   A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
  2411   One on another's neck do witness bear
  2412   Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
  2413     In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
  2414     And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
  2415 
  2416 
  2417                      132
  2418   Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
  2419   Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
  2420   Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
  2421   Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
  2422   And truly not the morning sun of heaven
  2423   Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
  2424   Nor that full star that ushers in the even
  2425   Doth half that glory to the sober west
  2426   As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
  2427   O let it then as well beseem thy heart
  2428   To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
  2429   And suit thy pity like in every part.
  2430     Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
  2431     And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
  2432 
  2433 
  2434                      133
  2435   Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
  2436   For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
  2437   Is't not enough to torture me alone,
  2438   But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
  2439   Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
  2440   And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
  2441   Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
  2442   A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
  2443   Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
  2444   But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,
  2445   Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
  2446   Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
  2447     And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
  2448     Perforce am thine and all that is in me.
  2449 
  2450 
  2451                      134
  2452   So now I have confessed that he is thine,
  2453   And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
  2454   My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,
  2455   Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
  2456   But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
  2457   For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
  2458   He learned but surety-like to write for me,
  2459   Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
  2460   The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
  2461   Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
  2462   And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
  2463   So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
  2464     Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,
  2465     He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
  2466 
  2467 
  2468                      135
  2469   Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
  2470   And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
  2471   More than enough am I that vex thee still,
  2472   To thy sweet will making addition thus.
  2473   Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
  2474   Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
  2475   Shall will in others seem right gracious,
  2476   And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
  2477   The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
  2478   And in abundance addeth to his store,
  2479   So thou being rich in will add to thy will
  2480   One will of mine to make thy large will more.
  2481     Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
  2482     Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'
  2483 
  2484 
  2485                      136
  2486   If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
  2487   Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
  2488   And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
  2489   Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
  2490   'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
  2491   Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
  2492   In things of great receipt with case we prove,
  2493   Among a number one is reckoned none.
  2494   Then in the number let me pass untold,
  2495   Though in thy store's account I one must be,
  2496   For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
  2497   That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.
  2498     Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
  2499     And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
  2500 
  2501 
  2502                      137
  2503   Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  2504   That they behold and see not what they see?
  2505   They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  2506   Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
  2507   If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,
  2508   Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
  2509   Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  2510   Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
  2511   Why should my heart think that a several plot,
  2512   Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
  2513   Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
  2514   To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
  2515     In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  2516     And to this false plague are they now transferred.
  2517 
  2518 
  2519                      138
  2520   When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  2521   I do believe her though I know she lies,
  2522   That she might think me some untutored youth,
  2523   Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
  2524   Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  2525   Although she knows my days are past the best,
  2526   Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
  2527   On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
  2528   But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
  2529   And wherefore say not I that I am old?
  2530   O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  2531   And age in love, loves not to have years told.
  2532     Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
  2533     And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
  2534 
  2535 
  2536                      139
  2537   O call not me to justify the wrong,
  2538   That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
  2539   Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
  2540   Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
  2541   Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
  2542   Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
  2543   What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
  2544   Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
  2545   Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
  2546   Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
  2547   And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
  2548   That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
  2549     Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,
  2550     Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
  2551 
  2552 
  2553                      140
  2554   Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
  2555   My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
  2556   Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
  2557   The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
  2558   If I might teach thee wit better it were,
  2559   Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
  2560   As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
  2561   No news but health from their physicians know.
  2562   For if I should despair I should grow mad,
  2563   And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
  2564   Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  2565   Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
  2566     That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
  2567     Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
  2568 
  2569 
  2570                      141
  2571   In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
  2572   For they in thee a thousand errors note,
  2573   But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
  2574   Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
  2575   Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
  2576   Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
  2577   Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
  2578   To any sensual feast with thee alone:
  2579   But my five wits, nor my five senses can
  2580   Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
  2581   Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
  2582   Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
  2583     Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
  2584     That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.
  2585 
  2586 
  2587                      142
  2588   Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
  2589   Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
  2590   O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
  2591   And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
  2592   Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
  2593   That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
  2594   And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
  2595   Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  2596   Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
  2597   Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
  2598   Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
  2599   Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
  2600     If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
  2601     By self-example mayst thou be denied.
  2602 
  2603 
  2604                      143
  2605   Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
  2606   One of her feathered creatures broke away,
  2607   Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
  2608   In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
  2609   Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
  2610   Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
  2611   To follow that which flies before her face:
  2612   Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  2613   So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,
  2614   Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,
  2615   But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
  2616   And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
  2617     So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
  2618     If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
  2619 
  2620 
  2621                      144
  2622   Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  2623   Which like two spirits do suggest me still,
  2624   The better angel is a man right fair:
  2625   The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
  2626   To win me soon to hell my female evil,
  2627   Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  2628   And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
  2629   Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  2630   And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
  2631   Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
  2632   But being both from me both to each friend,
  2633   I guess one angel in another's hell.
  2634     Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,
  2635     Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
  2636 
  2637 
  2638                      145
  2639   Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  2640   Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
  2641   To me that languished for her sake:
  2642   But when she saw my woeful state,
  2643   Straight in her heart did mercy come,
  2644   Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
  2645   Was used in giving gentle doom:
  2646   And taught it thus anew to greet:
  2647   'I hate' she altered with an end,
  2648   That followed it as gentle day,
  2649   Doth follow night who like a fiend
  2650   From heaven to hell is flown away.
  2651     'I hate', from hate away she threw,
  2652     And saved my life saying 'not you'.
  2653 
  2654 
  2655                      146
  2656   Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,
  2657   My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
  2658   Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
  2659   Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  2660   Why so large cost having so short a lease,
  2661   Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  2662   Shall worms inheritors of this excess
  2663   Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  2664   Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  2665   And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
  2666   Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
  2667   Within be fed, without be rich no more,
  2668     So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
  2669     And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
  2670 
  2671 
  2672                      147
  2673   My love is as a fever longing still,
  2674   For that which longer nurseth the disease,
  2675   Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  2676   Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
  2677   My reason the physician to my love,
  2678   Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
  2679   Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
  2680   Desire is death, which physic did except.
  2681   Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
  2682   And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
  2683   My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
  2684   At random from the truth vainly expressed.
  2685     For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
  2686     Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
  2687 
  2688 
  2689                      148
  2690   O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
  2691   Which have no correspondence with true sight,
  2692   Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  2693   That censures falsely what they see aright?
  2694   If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  2695   What means the world to say it is not so?
  2696   If it be not, then love doth well denote,
  2697   Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  2698   How can it? O how can love's eye be true,
  2699   That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  2700   No marvel then though I mistake my view,
  2701   The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
  2702     O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  2703     Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
  2704 
  2705 
  2706                      149
  2707   Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
  2708   When I against my self with thee partake?
  2709   Do I not think on thee when I forgot
  2710   Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
  2711   Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
  2712   On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
  2713   Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
  2714   Revenge upon my self with present moan?
  2715   What merit do I in my self respect,
  2716   That is so proud thy service to despise,
  2717   When all my best doth worship thy defect,
  2718   Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
  2719     But love hate on for now I know thy mind,
  2720     Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.
  2721 
  2722 
  2723                      150
  2724   O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
  2725   With insufficiency my heart to sway,
  2726   To make me give the lie to my true sight,
  2727   And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
  2728   Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
  2729   That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
  2730   There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
  2731   That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
  2732   Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
  2733   The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
  2734   O though I love what others do abhor,
  2735   With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
  2736     If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
  2737     More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
  2738 
  2739 
  2740                      151
  2741   Love is too young to know what conscience is,
  2742   Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  2743   Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
  2744   Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
  2745   For thou betraying me, I do betray
  2746   My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
  2747   My soul doth tell my body that he may,
  2748   Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
  2749   But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  2750   As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
  2751   He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  2752   To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
  2753     No want of conscience hold it that I call,
  2754     Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.
  2755 
  2756 
  2757                      152
  2758   In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
  2759   But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
  2760   In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  2761   In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  2762   But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
  2763   When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
  2764   For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
  2765   And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
  2766   For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
  2767   Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  2768   And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
  2769   Or made them swear against the thing they see.
  2770     For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
  2771     To swear against the truth so foul a be.
  2772 
  2773 
  2774                      153
  2775   Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
  2776   A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
  2777   And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
  2778   In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
  2779   Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
  2780   A dateless lively heat still to endure,
  2781   And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
  2782   Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
  2783   But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
  2784   The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
  2785   I sick withal the help of bath desired,
  2786   And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
  2787     But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,
  2788     Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.
  2789 
  2790 
  2791                      154
  2792   The little Love-god lying once asleep,
  2793   Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  2794   Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
  2795   Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
  2796   The fairest votary took up that fire,
  2797   Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
  2798   And so the general of hot desire,
  2799   Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
  2800   This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
  2801   Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
  2802   Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
  2803   For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,
  2804     Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
  2805     Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

  2870 SCENE:
  2871 Rousillon; Paris; Florence; Marseilles
  2872 
  2873 
  2874 ACT I. SCENE 1.
  2875 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
  2876 
  2877 Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black
  2878 
  2879   COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
  2880   BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;
  2881     but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in
  2882     ward, evermore in subjection.
  2883   LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
  2884     father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
  2885     necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
  2886     up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
  2887     abundance.
  2888   COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?
  2889   LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
  2890     practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
  2891     advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
  2892   COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
  2893     sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
  2894     honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature
  2895     immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
  2896     the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of
  2897     the King's disease.
  2898   LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
  2899   COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
  2900     great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
  2901   LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
  2902     of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
  2903     liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
  2904   BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
  2905   LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.
  2906   BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.
  2907   LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
  2908     daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
  2909   COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
  2910     overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
  2911     promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
  2912     fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
  2913     there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
  2914     too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives
  2915     her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
  2916   LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
  2917   COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
  2918     The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
  2919     tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
  2920     more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
  2921     you affect a sorrow than to have-
  2922   HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
  2923   LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
  2924     grief the enemy to the living.
  2925   COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
  2926     soon mortal.
  2927   BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
  2928   LAFEU. How understand we that?
  2929   COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
  2930     In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
  2931     Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
  2932     Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
  2933     Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
  2934     Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
  2935     Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
  2936     But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
  2937     That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
  2938     Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
  2939     'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
  2940     Advise him.
  2941   LAFEU. He cannot want the best
  2942     That shall attend his love.
  2943   COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
  2944   BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
  2945     servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your
  2946     mistress, and make much of her.
  2947   LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
  2948     father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
  2949   HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
  2950     And these great tears grace his remembrance more
  2951     Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
  2952     I have forgot him; my imagination
  2953     Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
  2954     I am undone; there is no living, none,
  2955     If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
  2956     That I should love a bright particular star
  2957     And think to wed it, he is so above me.
  2958     In his bright radiance and collateral light
  2959     Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
  2960     Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
  2961     The hind that would be mated by the lion
  2962     Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
  2963     To see him every hour; to sit and draw
  2964     His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
  2965     In our heart's table-heart too capable
  2966     Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
  2967     But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
  2968     Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?
  2969 
  2970                        Enter PAROLLES
  2971 
  2972     [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;
  2973     And yet I know him a notorious liar,
  2974     Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
  2975     Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
  2976     That they take place when virtue's steely bones
  2977     Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see
  2978     Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
  2979   PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!
  2980   HELENA. And you, monarch!
  2981   PAROLLES. No.
  2982   HELENA. And no.
  2983   PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?
  2984   HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a
  2985     question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it
  2986     against him?
  2987   PAROLLES. Keep him out.
  2988   HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the
  2989     defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
  2990   PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will
  2991     undermine you and blow you up.
  2992   HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
  2993     Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
  2994   PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown
  2995     up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
  2996      made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
  2997     of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
  2998     increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
  2999     lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
  3000     by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it
  3001     is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.
  3002   HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a
  3003     virgin.
  3004   PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule
  3005     of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
  3006     mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs
  3007     himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be
  3008     buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
  3009     offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
  3010     cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
  3011     feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,
  3012     idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
  3013     canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.
  3014     Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly
  3015     increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away
  3016     with't.
  3017   HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
  3018   PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.
  3019     'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
  3020     the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time
  3021     of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
  3022     fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
  3023     the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your
  3024     pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,
  3025     your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it
  3026     looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was
  3027     formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you
  3028     anything with it?
  3029   HELENA. Not my virginity yet.
  3030     There shall your master have a thousand loves,
  3031     A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
  3032     A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
  3033     A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
  3034     A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
  3035     His humble ambition, proud humility,
  3036     His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
  3037     His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
  3038     Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms
  3039     That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-
  3040     I know not what he shall. God send him well!
  3041     The court's a learning-place, and he is one-
  3042   PAROLLES. What one, i' faith?
  3043   HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
  3044   PAROLLES. What's pity?
  3045   HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't
  3046     Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
  3047     Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
  3048     Might with effects of them follow our friends
  3049     And show what we alone must think, which never
  3050     Returns us thanks.

  3055   PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will
  3056     think of thee at court.
  3057   HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
  3058   PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.
  3059   HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.
  3060   PAROLLES. Why under Man?
  3061   HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
  3062     under Mars.
  3063   PAROLLES. When he was predominant.
  3064   HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
  3065   PAROLLES. Why think you so?
  3066   HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.
  3067   PAROLLES. That's for advantage.
  3068   HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
  3069     composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
  3070     a good wing, and I like the wear well.
  3071   PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I
  3072     will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall
  3073     serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
  3074     counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else
  3075     thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
  3076     thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;
  3077     when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good
  3078     husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.

  3085     That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
  3086     The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
  3087     To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
  3088     Impossible be strange attempts to those
  3089     That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
  3090     What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
  3091     To show her merit that did miss her love?

  3099 Paris. The KING'S palace
  3100 
  3101 Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters,
  3102 and divers ATTENDANTS
  3103 
  3104   KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;
  3105     Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
  3106     A braving war.
  3107   FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir.
  3108   KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,
  3109     A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
  3110     With caution, that the Florentine will move us
  3111     For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
  3112     Prejudicates the business, and would seem
  3113     To have us make denial.
  3114   FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,
  3115     Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead
  3116     For amplest credence.
  3117   KING. He hath arm'd our answer,
  3118     And Florence is denied before he comes;
  3119     Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
  3120     The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
  3121     To stand on either part.
  3122   SECOND LORD. It well may serve
  3123     A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
  3124     For breathing and exploit.
  3125   KING. What's he comes here?
  3126 
  3127               Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
  3128 
  3129   FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
  3130     Young Bertram.
  3131   KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
  3132     Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
  3133     Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
  3134     Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
  3135   BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
  3136   KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,
  3137     As when thy father and myself in friendship
  3138     First tried our soldiership. He did look far
  3139     Into the service of the time, and was
  3140     Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
  3141     But on us both did haggish age steal on,
  3142     And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
  3143     To talk of your good father. In his youth
  3144     He had the wit which I can well observe
  3145     To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
  3146     Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
  3147     Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
  3148     So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
  3149     Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
  3150     His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
  3151     Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
  3152     Exception bid him speak, and at this time
  3153     His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him
  3154     He us'd as creatures of another place;
  3155     And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
  3156     Making them proud of his humility
  3157     In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
  3158     Might be a copy to these younger times;
  3159     Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now
  3160     But goers backward.
  3161   BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,
  3162     Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
  3163     So in approof lives not his epitaph
  3164     As in your royal speech.
  3165   KING. Would I were with him! He would always say-
  3166     Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
  3167     He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them
  3168     To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-
  3169     This his good melancholy oft began,
  3170     On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
  3171     When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he
  3172     'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
  3173     Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
  3174     All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
  3175     Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
  3176     Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.
  3177     I, after him, do after him wish too,
  3178     Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
  3179     I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
  3180     To give some labourers room.
  3181   SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;
  3182     They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
  3183   KING. I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,
  3184     Since the physician at your father's died?
  3185     He was much fam'd.
  3186   BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.
  3187   KING. If he were living, I would try him yet-
  3188     Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
  3189     With several applications. Nature and sickness
  3190     Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;
  3191     My son's no dearer.
  3192   BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty.                 Exeunt [Flourish]

  3199 
  3200 Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN
  3201 
  3202   COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
  3203   STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish
  3204     might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
  3205     wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
  3206     when of ourselves we publish them.
  3207   COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
  3208     complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my
  3209     slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit
  3210     them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
  3211   CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
  3212   COUNTESS. Well, sir.
  3213   CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of
  3214     the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will
  3215     to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
  3216   COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
  3217   CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.
  3218   COUNTESS. In what case?
  3219   CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
  3220     think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o'
  3221     my body; for they say bames are blessings.
  3222   COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
  3223   CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
  3224     flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
  3225   COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?
  3226   CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
  3227   COUNTESS. May the world know them?
  3228   CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
  3229     and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
  3230   COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
  3231   CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for
  3232     my wife's sake.
  3233   COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
  3234   CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come
  3235     to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land
  3236     spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his
  3237     cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the
  3238     cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and
  3239     blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
  3240     is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
  3241     could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in
  3242     marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
  3243     papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their
  3244     heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer
  3245     i' th' herd.
  3246   COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
  3247   CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:
  3248 
  3249               For I the ballad will repeat,
  3250                 Which men full true shall find:
  3251               Your marriage comes by destiny,
  3252                 Your cuckoo sings by kind.
  3253 
  3254   COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
  3255   STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
  3256     Of her I am to speak.
  3257   COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen
  3258     I mean.
  3259   CLOWN.  [Sings]
  3260 
  3261                'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she
  3262                  'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
  3263                Fond done, done fond,
  3264                  Was this King Priam's joy?'
  3265                With that she sighed as she stood,
  3266                With that she sighed as she stood,
  3267                  And gave this sentence then:
  3268                'Among nine bad if one be good,
  3269                Among nine bad if one be good,
  3270                  There's yet one good in ten.'
  3271 
  3272   COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
  3273   CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th'
  3274     song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find
  3275     no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten,
  3276     quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing
  3277     star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man
  3278     may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.
  3279   COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
  3280   CLOWN. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!
  3281     Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
  3282     wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.
  3283     I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
  3284  Exit
  3285   COUNTESS. Well, now.
  3286   STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
  3287   COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she
  3288     herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
  3289     much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and
  3290     more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
  3291   STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she
  3292     wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
  3293     words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
  3294     touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your
  3295     son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
  3296     difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not
  3297     extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen
  3298     of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without
  3299     rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she
  3300     deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard
  3301     virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you
  3302     withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
  3303     something to know it.
  3304   COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.
  3305     Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so
  3306     tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor
  3307     misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
  3308     thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further
  3309     anon.                                           Exit STEWARD
  3310 
  3311                             Enter HELENA
  3312 
  3313     Even so it was with me when I was young.
  3314     If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
  3315     Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
  3316     Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
  3317     It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
  3318     Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.
  3319     By our remembrances of days foregone,
  3320     Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
  3321     Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.
  3322   HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?
  3323   COUNTESS. You know, Helen,
  3324     I am a mother to you.
  3325   HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.
  3326   COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.
  3327     Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
  3328     Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'
  3329     That you start at it? I say I am your mother,
  3330     And put you in the catalogue of those
  3331     That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen
  3332     Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
  3333     A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
  3334     You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
  3335     Yet I express to you a mother's care.
  3336     God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
  3337     To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
  3338     That this distempered messenger of wet,
  3339     The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
  3340     Why, that you are my daughter?
  3341   HELENA. That I am not.
  3342   COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.
  3343   HELENA. Pardon, madam.
  3344     The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
  3345     I am from humble, he from honoured name;
  3346     No note upon my parents, his all noble.
  3347     My master, my dear lord he is; and I
  3348     His servant live, and will his vassal die.
  3349     He must not be my brother.
  3350   COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?
  3351   HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-
  3352     So that my lord your son were not my brother-
  3353     Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
  3354     I care no more for than I do for heaven,
  3355     So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
  3356     But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
  3357   COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
  3358     God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'
  3359     So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?
  3360     My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see
  3361     The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find
  3362     Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross
  3363     You love my son; invention is asham'd,
  3364     Against the proclamation of thy passion,
  3365     To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
  3366     But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
  3367     Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
  3368     See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
  3369     That in their kind they speak it; only sin
  3370     And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
  3371     That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
  3372     If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
  3373     If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,
  3374     As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
  3375     To tell me truly.
  3376   HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.
  3377   COUNTESS. Do you love my son?
  3378   HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.
  3379   COUNTESS. Love you my son?
  3380   HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?
  3381   COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
  3382     Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
  3383     The state of your affection; for your passions
  3384     Have to the full appeach'd.
  3385   HELENA. Then I confess,
  3386     Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
  3387     That before you, and next unto high heaven,
  3388     I love your son.
  3389     My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.
  3390     Be not offended, for it hurts not him
  3391     That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not
  3392     By any token of presumptuous suit,
  3393     Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
  3394     Yet never know how that desert should be.
  3395     I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
  3396     Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
  3397     I still pour in the waters of my love,
  3398     And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
  3399     Religious in mine error, I adore
  3400     The sun that looks upon his worshipper
  3401     But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
  3402     Let not your hate encounter with my love,
  3403     For loving where you do; but if yourself,
  3404     Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
  3405     Did ever in so true a flame of liking
  3406     Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
  3407     Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity
  3408     To her whose state is such that cannot choose
  3409     But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
  3410     That seeks not to find that her search implies,
  3411     But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!
  3412   COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-
  3413     To go to Paris?
  3414   HELENA. Madam, I had.
  3415   COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.
  3416   HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
  3417     You know my father left me some prescriptions
  3418     Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
  3419     And manifest experience had collected
  3420     For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
  3421     In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
  3422     As notes whose faculties inclusive were
  3423     More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
  3424     There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,
  3425     To cure the desperate languishings whereof
  3426     The King is render'd lost.
  3427   COUNTESS. This was your motive
  3428     For Paris, was it? Speak.
  3429   HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,
  3430     Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
  3431     Had from the conversation of my thoughts
  3432     Haply been absent then.
  3433   COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,
  3434     If you should tender your supposed aid,
  3435     He would receive it? He and his physicians
  3436     Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;
  3437     They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
  3438     A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
  3439     Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off
  3440     The danger to itself?
  3441   HELENA. There's something in't
  3442     More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
  3443     Of his profession, that his good receipt
  3444     Shall for my legacy be sanctified
  3445     By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
  3446     But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
  3447     The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.
  3448     By such a day and hour.
  3449   COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?
  3450   HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.
  3451   COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
  3452     Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
  3453     To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,
  3454     And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
  3455     Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
  3456     What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt
  3457

  3472 ACT II. SCENE 1.
  3473 Paris. The KING'S palace
  3474 
  3475 Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave
  3476 for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS
  3477 
  3478   KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles
  3479     Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;
  3480     Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
  3481     The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
  3482     And is enough for both.
  3483   FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,
  3484     After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
  3485     And find your Grace in health.
  3486   KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
  3487     Will not confess he owes the malady
  3488     That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
  3489     Whether I live or die, be you the sons
  3490     Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
  3491     Those bated that inherit but the fall
  3492     Of the last monarchy-see that you come
  3493     Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
  3494     The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
  3495     That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.
  3496   SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
  3497   KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
  3498     They say our French lack language to deny,
  3499     If they demand; beware of being captives
  3500     Before you serve.
  3501     BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.
  3502   KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.
  3503                                        The KING retires attended
  3504   FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
  3505   PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.
  3506     SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!
  3507   PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.
  3508   BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with
  3509     'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
  3510   PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
  3511   BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
  3512     Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
  3513     Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn
  3514     But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.
  3515   FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.
  3516   PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.
  3517   SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.
  3518   BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
  3519   FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.
  3520   SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
  3521   PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
  3522     lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of
  3523     the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
  3524     war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
  3525     entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.
  3526   FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.
  3527   PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS
  3528     What will ye do?
  3529 
  3530                             Re-enter the KING
  3531 
  3532   BERTRAM. Stay; the King!
  3533   PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
  3534     restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
  3535     expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
  3536     time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
  3537     influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead
  3538     the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more
  3539     dilated farewell.
  3540   BERTRAM. And I will do so.
  3541   PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
  3542                                      Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES
  3543 
  3544                               Enter LAFEU
  3545 
  3546   LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
  3547   KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.
  3548   LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.
  3549     I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
  3550     And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
  3551   KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
  3552     And ask'd thee mercy for't.
  3553   LAFEU. Good faith, across!
  3554     But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
  3555     Of your infirmity?
  3556   KING. No.
  3557   LAFEU. O, will you eat
  3558     No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
  3559     My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
  3560     Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
  3561     That's able to breathe life into a stone,
  3562     Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
  3563     With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
  3564     Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
  3565     To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
  3566     And write to her a love-line.
  3567   KING. What her is this?
  3568   LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,
  3569     If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
  3570     If seriously I may convey my thoughts
  3571     In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
  3572     With one that in her sex, her years, profession,
  3573     Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
  3574     Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
  3575     For that is her demand, and know her business?
  3576     That done, laugh well at me.
  3577   KING. Now, good Lafeu,
  3578     Bring in the admiration, that we with the
  3579     May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
  3580     By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
  3581   LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,
  3582     And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
  3583   KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
  3584 
  3585                    Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA
  3586 
  3587   LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.
  3588   KING. This haste hath wings indeed.
  3589   LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;
  3590     This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
  3591     A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
  3592     His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,
  3593     That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit
  3594   KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  3595   HELENA. Ay, my good lord.
  3596     Gerard de Narbon was my father,
  3597     In what he did profess, well found.
  3598   KING. I knew him.
  3599   HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
  3600     Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
  3601     Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
  3602     Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
  3603     And of his old experience th' only darling,
  3604     He bade me store up as a triple eye,
  3605     Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:
  3606     And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
  3607     With that malignant cause wherein the honour
  3608     Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
  3609     I come to tender it, and my appliance,
  3610     With all bound humbleness.
  3611   KING. We thank you, maiden;
  3612     But may not be so credulous of cure,
  3613     When our most learned doctors leave us, and
  3614     The congregated college have concluded
  3615     That labouring art can never ransom nature
  3616     From her inaidable estate-I say we must not
  3617     So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
  3618     To prostitute our past-cure malady
  3619     To empirics; or to dissever so
  3620     Our great self and our credit to esteem
  3621     A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
  3622   HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
  3623     I will no more enforce mine office on you;
  3624     Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
  3625     A modest one to bear me back again.
  3626   KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
  3627     Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
  3628     As one near death to those that wish him live.
  3629     But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;
  3630     I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
  3631   HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,
  3632     Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
  3633     He that of greatest works is finisher
  3634     Oft does them by the weakest minister.
  3635     So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
  3636     When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
  3637     From simple sources, and great seas have dried
  3638     When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
  3639     Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
  3640     Where most it promises; and oft it hits
  3641     Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.
  3642   KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
  3643     Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
  3644     Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
  3645   HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.
  3646     It is not so with Him that all things knows,
  3647     As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
  3648     But most it is presumption in us when
  3649     The help of heaven we count the act of men.
  3650     Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
  3651     Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
  3652     I am not an impostor, that proclaim
  3653     Myself against the level of mine aim;
  3654     But know I think, and think I know most sure,
  3655     My art is not past power nor you past cure.
  3656   KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space
  3657     Hop'st thou my cure?
  3658   HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.
  3659     Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
  3660     Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
  3661     Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
  3662     Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
  3663     Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
  3664     Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
  3665     What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
  3666     Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
  3667   KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence
  3668     What dar'st thou venture?
  3669   HELENA. Tax of impudence,
  3670     A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
  3671     Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name
  3672     Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended
  3673     With vilest torture let my life be ended.
  3674   KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
  3675     His powerful sound within an organ weak;
  3676     And what impossibility would slay
  3677     In common sense, sense saves another way.
  3678     Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
  3679     Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
  3680     Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
  3681     That happiness and prime can happy call.
  3682     Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
  3683     Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
  3684     Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
  3685     That ministers thine own death if I die.
  3686   HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property
  3687     Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;
  3688     And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
  3689     But, if I help, what do you promise me?
  3690   KING. Make thy demand.
  3691   HELENA. But will you make it even?
  3692   KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
  3693   HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
  3694     What husband in thy power I will command.
  3695     Exempted be from me the arrogance
  3696     To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
  3697     My low and humble name to propagate
  3698     With any branch or image of thy state;
  3699     But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
  3700     Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
  3701   KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
  3702     Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.
  3703     So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
  3704     Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
  3705     More should I question thee, and more I must,
  3706     Though more to know could not be more to trust,
  3707     From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest
  3708     Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
  3709     Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
  3710     As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
  3711                                               [Flourish. Exeunt]

  3716 ACT II. SCENE 2.
  3717 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
  3718 
  3719 Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
  3720 
  3721   COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your
  3722     breeding.
  3723   CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my
  3724     business is but to the court.
  3725   COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you
  3726     put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
  3727   CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may
  3728     easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's
  3729     cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip,
  3730     nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for
  3731     the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
  3732   COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
  3733   CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
  3734     buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
  3735   COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
  3736   CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
  3737     French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's
  3738     forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,
  3739     as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
  3740     quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's
  3741     mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
  3742   COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all
  3743     questions?
  3744   CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit
  3745     any question.
  3746   COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
  3747     all demands.
  3748   CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should
  3749     speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me
  3750     if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
  3751   COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in
  3752     question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir,
  3753     are you a courtier?
  3754   CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a
  3755     hundred of them.
  3756   COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
  3757   CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.
  3758   COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
  3759   CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
  3760   COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
  3761   CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
  3762   COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare
  3763     not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your
  3764     whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were
  3765     but bound to't.
  3766   CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
  3767     thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.
  3768   COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,
  3769     To entertain it so merrily with a fool.
  3770   CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
  3771   COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,
  3772     And urge her to a present answer back;
  3773     Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.
  3774   CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?
  3775   COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?
  3776   CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
  3777   COUNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt
  3778

  3782 ACT II. SCENE 3.
  3783 Paris. The KING'S palace
  3784 
  3785 Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES
  3786 
  3787   LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
  3788     persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
  3789     causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
  3790     ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
  3791     ourselves to an unknown fear.
  3792   PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
  3793     out in our latter times.
  3794   BERTRAM. And so 'tis.
  3795   LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-
  3796   PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
  3797   LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
  3798   PAROLLES. Right; so I say.
  3799   LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-
  3800   PAROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
  3801   LAFEU. Not to be help'd-
  3802   PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
  3803   LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death.
  3804   PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.
  3805   LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
  3806   PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall
  3807     read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
  3808   LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly
  3809     Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
  3810   PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.
  3811   LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in
  3812     respect-
  3813   PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief
  3814     and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
  3815     will not acknowledge it to be the-
  3816   LAFEU. Very hand of heaven.
  3817   PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.
  3818   LAFEU. In a most weak-
  3819   PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;
  3820     which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone
  3821     the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
  3822   LAFEU. Generally thankful.
  3823 
  3824                  Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS
  3825 
  3826   PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
  3827   LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
  3828     whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
  3829     coranto.
  3830   PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
  3831   LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so.
  3832   KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.
  3833                                                Exit an ATTENDANT
  3834     Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
  3835     And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
  3836     Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive
  3837     The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
  3838     Which but attends thy naming.
  3839 
  3840                      Enter three or four LORDS
  3841 
  3842     Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
  3843     Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
  3844     O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
  3845     I have to use. Thy frank election make;
  3846     Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
  3847   HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
  3848     Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!
  3849   LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
  3850     My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
  3851     And writ as little beard.
  3852   KING. Peruse them well.
  3853     Not one of those but had a noble father.
  3854   HELENA. Gentlemen,
  3855     Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.
  3856   ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
  3857   HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
  3858     That I protest I simply am a maid.
  3859     Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
  3860     The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
  3861     'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
  3862     Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
  3863     We'll ne'er come there again.'
  3864   KING. Make choice and see:
  3865     Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
  3866   HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
  3867     And to imperial Love, that god most high,
  3868     Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  3869   FIRST LORD. And grant it.
  3870   HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
  3871   LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
  3872     life.
  3873   HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
  3874     Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.
  3875     Love make your fortunes twenty times above
  3876     Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
  3877   SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.
  3878   HELENA. My wish receive,
  3879     Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.
  3880   LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
  3881     them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
  3882   HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
  3883     I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.
  3884     Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
  3885     Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
  3886   LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
  3887     Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
  3888   HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,
  3889     To make yourself a son out of my blood.
  3890   FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.
  3891   LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but
  3892     if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known
  3893     thee already.
  3894   HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
  3895     Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
  3896     Into your guiding power. This is the man.
  3897   KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
  3898   BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
  3899     In such a business give me leave to use
  3900     The help of mine own eyes.
  3901   KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,
  3902     What she has done for me?
  3903   BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;
  3904     But never hope to know why I should marry her.
  3905   KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
  3906   BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
  3907     Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
  3908     She had her breeding at my father's charge.
  3909     A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
  3910     Rather corrupt me ever!
  3911   KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
  3912     I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
  3913     Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
  3914     Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
  3915     In differences so mighty. If she be
  3916     All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
  3917     A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
  3918     Of virtue for the name; but do not so.
  3919     From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
  3920     The place is dignified by the doer's deed;
  3921     Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
  3922     It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
  3923     Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
  3924     The property by what it is should go,
  3925     Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
  3926     In these to nature she's immediate heir;
  3927     And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
  3928     Which challenges itself as honour's born
  3929     And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
  3930     When rather from our acts we them derive
  3931     Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,
  3932     Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
  3933     A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
  3934     Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
  3935     Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
  3936     If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
  3937     I can create the rest. Virtue and she
  3938     Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
  3939   BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
  3940   KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
  3941   HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
  3942     Let the rest go.
  3943   KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
  3944     I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
  3945     Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
  3946     That dost in vile misprision shackle up
  3947     My love and her desert; that canst not dream
  3948     We, poising us in her defective scale,
  3949     Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
  3950     It is in us to plant thine honour where
  3951     We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
  3952     Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
  3953     Believe not thy disdain, but presently
  3954     Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
  3955     Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
  3956     Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
  3957     Into the staggers and the careless lapse
  3958     Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
  3959     Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
  3960     Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
  3961   BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
  3962     My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
  3963     What great creation and what dole of honour
  3964     Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late
  3965     Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
  3966     The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
  3967     Is as 'twere born so.
  3968   KING. Take her by the hand,
  3969     And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
  3970     A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
  3971     A balance more replete.
  3972   BERTRAM. I take her hand.
  3973   KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King
  3974     Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
  3975     Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
  3976     And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
  3977     Shall more attend upon the coming space,
  3978     Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
  3979     Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
  3980               Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,
  3981                                       commenting of this wedding
  3982   LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
  3983   PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?
  3984   LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
  3985   PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
  3986   LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?
  3987   PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
  3988     succeeding. My master!
  3989   LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
  3990   PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
  3991   LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
  3992   PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
  3993     old.
  3994   LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
  3995     cannot bring thee.
  3996   PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
  3997   LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
  3998     fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
  3999     pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
  4000     dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
  4001     have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
  4002     thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
  4003     worth.
  4004   PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
  4005   LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
  4006     trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
  4007     window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
  4008     for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
  4009   PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
  4010   LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
  4011   PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
  4012   LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
  4013     a scruple.
  4014   PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.
  4015   LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
  4016     o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
  4017     beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
  4018     have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
  4019     knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
  4020   PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
  4021   LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
  4022     eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
  4023     age will give me leave.                                 Exit
  4024   PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
  4025     scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
  4026     is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
  4027     meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
  4028     lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
  4029     I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.
  4030 
  4031                          Re-enter LAFEU
  4032 
  4033   LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
  4034     you; you have a new mistress.
  4035   PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
  4036     reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve
  4037     above is my master.
  4038   LAFEU. Who? God?
  4039   PAROLLES. Ay, sir.
  4040   LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
  4041     thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
  4042     servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
  4043     stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat
  4044     thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
  4045     beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe
  4046     themselves upon thee.
  4047   PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
  4048   LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
  4049     out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
  4050     you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
  4051     commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
  4052     not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.
  4053  Exit
  4054 
  4055                            Enter BERTRAM
  4056 
  4057   PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
  4058     be conceal'd awhile.
  4059   BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
  4060   PAROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?
  4061   BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
  4062     I will not bed her.
  4063   PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?
  4064   BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!
  4065     I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
  4066   PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
  4067     The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!
  4068   BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
  4069     not yet.
  4070   PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
  4071       wars!
  4072     He wears his honour in a box unseen
  4073     That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
  4074     Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
  4075     Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
  4076     Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!
  4077     France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
  4078     Therefore, to th' war!
  4079   BERTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,
  4080     Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
  4081     And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
  4082     That which I durst not speak. His present gift
  4083     Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
  4084     Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
  4085     To the dark house and the detested wife.
  4086   PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
  4087   BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
  4088     I'll send her straight away. To-morrow
  4089     I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
  4090   PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
  4091     A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
  4092     Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.
  4093     The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.      Exeunt

  4098 ACT II. SCENE 4.
  4099 Paris. The KING'S palace
  4100 
  4101 Enter HELENA and CLOWN
  4102 
  4103   HELENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
  4104   CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
  4105     merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very
  4106     well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.
  4107   HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
  4108     well?
  4109   CLOWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
  4110   HELENA. What two things?
  4111   CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
  4112     The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!
  4113 
  4114                         Enter PAROLLES
  4115 
  4116   PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!
  4117   HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good
  4118     fortunes.
  4119   PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,
  4120     have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
  4121   CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
  4122     did as you say.
  4123   PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.
  4124   CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
  4125     out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know
  4126     nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your
  4127     title, which is within a very little of nothing.
  4128   PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.
  4129   CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';
  4130     that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.
  4131   PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
  4132   CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
  4133     me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
  4134     in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
  4135     laughter.
  4136   PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
  4137     Madam, my lord will go away to-night:
  4138     A very serious business calls on him.
  4139     The great prerogative and rite of love,
  4140     Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
  4141     But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
  4142     Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
  4143     Which they distil now in the curbed time,
  4144     To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
  4145     And pleasure drown the brim.
  4146   HELENA. What's his else?
  4147   PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,
  4148     And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
  4149     Strength'ned with what apology you think
  4150     May make it probable need.
  4151   HELENA. What more commands he?
  4152   PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently
  4153     Attend his further pleasure.
  4154   HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.
  4155   PAROLLES. I shall report it so.
  4156   HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES
  4157     Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt

  4162 ACT II. SCENE 5.
  4163 Paris. The KING'S palace
  4164 
  4165 Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM
  4166 
  4167   LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
  4168   BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
  4169   LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.
  4170   BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.
  4171   LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
  4172   BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
  4173     and accordingly valiant.
  4174   LAFEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
  4175     against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
  4176     cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
  4177     make us friends; I will pursue the amity
  4178 
  4179                          Enter PAROLLES
  4180 
  4181   PAROLLES.  [To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
  4182   LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
  4183   PAROLLES. Sir!
  4184   LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
  4185     very good tailor.
  4186   BERTRAM.  [Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?
  4187   PAROLLES. She is.
  4188   BERTRAM. Will she away to-night?
  4189   PAROLLES. As you'll have her.
  4190   BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
  4191     Given order for our horses; and to-night,
  4192     When I should take possession of the bride,
  4193     End ere I do begin.
  4194   LAFEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
  4195     but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
  4196     thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
  4197     God save you, Captain.
  4198   BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
  4199   PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
  4200     displeasure.
  4201   LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
  4202     like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
  4203     again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
  4204   BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
  4205   LAFEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
  4206     Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
  4207     kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
  4208     trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
  4209     tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
  4210     better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
  4211     must do good against evil.                              Exit
  4212   PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.
  4213   BERTRAM. I think so.
  4214   PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?
  4215   BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech
  4216     Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
  4217 
  4218                           Enter HELENA
  4219 
  4220   HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
  4221     Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave
  4222     For present parting; only he desires
  4223     Some private speech with you.
  4224   BERTRAM. I shall obey his will.
  4225     You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
  4226     Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
  4227     The ministration and required office
  4228     On my particular. Prepar'd I was not
  4229     For such a business; therefore am I found
  4230     So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
  4231     That presently you take your way for home,
  4232     And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
  4233     For my respects are better than they seem,
  4234     And my appointments have in them a need
  4235     Greater than shows itself at the first view
  4236     To you that know them not. This to my mother.
  4237                                                [Giving a letter]
  4238     'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
  4239     I leave you to your wisdom.
  4240   HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say
  4241     But that I am your most obedient servant.
  4242   BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.
  4243   HELENA. And ever shall
  4244     With true observance seek to eke out that
  4245     Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
  4246     To equal my great fortune.
  4247   BERTRAM. Let that go.
  4248     My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.
  4249   HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.
  4250   BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?
  4251   HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
  4252     Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
  4253     But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
  4254     What law does vouch mine own.
  4255   BERTRAM. What would you have?
  4256   HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
  4257     I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
  4258     Faith, yes:
  4259     Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
  4260   BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
  4261   HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
  4262   BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur?
  4263     Farewell!                                        Exit HELENA
  4264     Go thou toward home, where I will never come
  4265     Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
  4266     Away, and for our flight.
  4267   PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio!                             Exeunt

  4285 
  4286         Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, attended; two
  4287                FRENCH LORDS, with a TROOP OF SOLDIERS
  4288 
  4289   DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you hear
  4290     The fundamental reasons of this war;
  4291     Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
  4292     And more thirsts after.
  4293   FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel
  4294     Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
  4295     On the opposer.
  4296   DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
  4297     Would in so just a business shut his bosom
  4298     Against our borrowing prayers.
  4299   SECOND LORD. Good my lord,
  4300     The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
  4301     But like a common and an outward man
  4302     That the great figure of a council frames
  4303     By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
  4304     Say what I think of it, since I have found
  4305     Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
  4306     As often as I guess'd.
  4307   DUKE. Be it his pleasure.
  4308   FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature,
  4309     That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
  4310     Come here for physic.
  4311   DUKE. Welcome shall they be
  4312     And all the honours that can fly from us
  4313     Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
  4314     When better fall, for your avails they fell.
  4315     To-morrow to th' field. Flourish.                     Exeunt

  4321 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
  4322 
  4323 Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
  4324 
  4325   COUNTESS. It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he
  4326     comes not along with her.
  4327   CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
  4328     man.
  4329   COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?
  4330   CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
  4331     sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a
  4332     man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
  4333     song.
  4334   COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
  4335                                               [Opening a letter]
  4336   CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling
  4337     and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
  4338     your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;
  4339     and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
  4340   COUNTESS. What have we here?
  4341   CLOWN. E'en that you have there.                          Exit
  4342   COUNTESS.  [Reads]  'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath
  4343     recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded
  4344     her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shall hear I am run
  4345     away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough
  4346     in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
  4347                                            Your unfortunate son,
  4348                                                        BERTRAM.'
  4349     This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
  4350     To fly the favours of so good a king,
  4351     To pluck his indignation on thy head
  4352     By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
  4353     For the contempt of empire.
  4354 
  4355                            Re-enter CLOWN
  4356 
  4357   CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
  4358     and my young lady.
  4359   COUNTESS. What is the -matter?
  4360   CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your
  4361     son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.
  4362   COUNTESS. Why should he be kill'd?
  4363   CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
  4364     danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
  4365     the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my
  4366     part, I only hear your son was run away.                Exit
  4367 
  4368               Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN
  4369 
  4370   SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.
  4371   HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
  4372   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.
  4373   COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen-
  4374     I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
  4375     That the first face of neither, on the start,
  4376     Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
  4377   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
  4378     We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
  4379     And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
  4380     Thither we bend again.
  4381   HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.
  4382     [Reads]  'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which
  4383     never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body
  4384     that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" I
  4385     write a "never."
  4386     This is a dreadful sentence.
  4387   COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
  4388   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;
  4389     And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
  4390   COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
  4391     If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
  4392     Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
  4393     But I do wash his name out of my blood,
  4394     And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
  4395   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.
  4396   COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?
  4397   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
  4398     The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
  4399     That good convenience claims.
  4400   COUNTESS. Return you thither?
  4401   SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
  4402   HELENA.  [Reads]  'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
  4403     'Tis bitter.
  4404   COUNTESS. Find you that there?
  4405   HELENA. Ay, madam.
  4406   SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which
  4407     his heart was not consenting to.
  4408   COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!
  4409     There's nothing here that is too good for him
  4410     But only she; and she deserves a lord
  4411     That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
  4412     And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
  4413   SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman
  4414     Which I have sometime known.
  4415   COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?
  4416   SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.
  4417   COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
  4418     My son corrupts a well-derived nature
  4419     With his inducement.
  4420   SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,
  4421     The fellow has a deal of that too much
  4422     Which holds him much to have.
  4423   COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.
  4424     I will entreat you, when you see my son,
  4425     To tell him that his sword can never win
  4426     The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you
  4427     Written to bear along.
  4428   FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,
  4429     In that and all your worthiest affairs.
  4430   COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
  4431     Will you draw near?            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN
  4432   HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
  4433     Nothing in France until he has no wife!
  4434     Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
  4435     Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
  4436     That chase thee from thy country, and expose
  4437     Those tender limbs of thine to the event
  4438     Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
  4439     That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
  4440     Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
  4441     Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
  4442     That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
  4443     Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
  4444     That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
  4445     Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
  4446     Whoever charges on his forward breast,
  4447     I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
  4448     And though I kill him not, I am the cause
  4449     His death was so effected. Better 'twere
  4450     I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
  4451     With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
  4452     That all the miseries which nature owes
  4453     Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
  4454     Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
  4455     As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
  4456     My being here it is that holds thee hence.
  4457     Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
  4458     The air of paradise did fan the house,
  4459     And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
  4460     That pitiful rumour may report my flight
  4461     To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.
  4462     For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit
  4463

  4467 ACT III. SCENE 3.
  4468 Florence. Before the DUKE's palace
  4469 
  4470 Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS,
  4471 drum and trumpets
  4472 
  4473   DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
  4474     Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
  4475     Upon thy promising fortune.
  4476   BERTRAM. Sir, it is
  4477     A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
  4478     We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
  4479     To th' extreme edge of hazard.
  4480   DUKE. Then go thou forth;
  4481     And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
  4482     As thy auspicious mistress!
  4483   BERTRAM. This very day,
  4484     Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
  4485     Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
  4486     A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
  4487

  4491 ACT III. SCENE 4.
  4492 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
  4493 
  4494 Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD
  4495 
  4496   COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
  4497     Might you not know she would do as she has done
  4498     By sending me a letter? Read it again.
  4499   STEWARD.  [Reads]  'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
  4500     Ambitious love hath so in me offended
  4501     That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
  4502     With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
  4503     Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
  4504     My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
  4505     Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
  4506     His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
  4507     His taken labours bid him me forgive;
  4508     I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
  4509     From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
  4510     Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
  4511     He is too good and fair for death and me;
  4512     Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'
  4513   COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
  4514     Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
  4515     As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,
  4516     I could have well diverted her intents,
  4517     Which thus she hath prevented.
  4518   STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;
  4519     If I had given you this at over-night,
  4520     She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes
  4521     Pursuit would be but vain.
  4522   COUNTESS. What angel shall
  4523     Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
  4524     Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
  4525     And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
  4526     Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
  4527     To this unworthy husband of his wife;
  4528     Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
  4529     That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
  4530     Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
  4531     Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
  4532     When haply he shall hear that she is gone
  4533     He will return; and hope I may that she,
  4534     Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
  4535     Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
  4536     Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
  4537     To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
  4538     My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
  4539     Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     Exeunt

  4544 ACT III. SCENE 5.
  4545 
  4546 Without the walls of Florence
  4547 A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
  4548 VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS
  4549 
  4550   WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose
  4551     all the sight.
  4552   DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service.
  4553   WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander;
  4554     and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.  [Tucket]
  4555     We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you
  4556     may know by their trumpets.
  4557   MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the
  4558     report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the
  4559     honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
  4560     honesty.
  4561   WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a
  4562     gentleman his companion.
  4563   MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
  4564     officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of
  4565     them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all
  4566     these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a
  4567     maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that
  4568     so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that
  4569     dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that
  4570     threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I
  4571     hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there
  4572     were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
  4573   DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.
  4574 
  4575             Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim
  4576 
  4577   WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie
  4578     at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her.
  4579     God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?
  4580   HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.
  4581     Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
  4582   WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
  4583   HELENA. Is this the way?
  4584                                                   [A march afar]
  4585   WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.
  4586     If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
  4587     But till the troops come by,
  4588     I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;
  4589     The rather for I think I know your hostess
  4590     As ample as myself.
  4591   HELENA. Is it yourself?
  4592   WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.
  4593   HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
  4594   WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?
  4595   HELENA. I did so.
  4596   WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours
  4597     That has done worthy service.
  4598   HELENA. His name, I pray you.
  4599   DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
  4600   HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;
  4601     His face I know not.
  4602   DIANA. What some'er he is,
  4603     He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
  4604     As 'tis reported, for the King had married him
  4605     Against his liking. Think you it is so?
  4606   HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.
  4607   DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count
  4608     Reports but coarsely of her.
  4609   HELENA. What's his name?
  4610   DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.
  4611   HELENA. O, I believe with him,
  4612     In argument of praise, or to the worth
  4613     Of the great Count himself, she is too mean
  4614     To have her name repeated; all her deserving
  4615     Is a reserved honesty, and that
  4616     I have not heard examin'd.
  4617   DIANA. Alas, poor lady!
  4618     'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
  4619     Of a detesting lord.
  4620   WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is
  4621     Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her
  4622     A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
  4623   HELENA. How do you mean?
  4624     May be the amorous Count solicits her
  4625     In the unlawful purpose.
  4626   WIDOW. He does, indeed;
  4627     And brokes with all that can in such a suit
  4628     Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
  4629     But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
  4630     In honestest defence.
  4631 
  4632     Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
  4633                           whole ARMY
  4634 
  4635   MARIANA. The gods forbid else!
  4636   WIDOW. So, now they come.
  4637     That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
  4638     That, Escalus.
  4639   HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?
  4640   DIANA. He-
  4641     That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.
  4642     I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester
  4643     He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?
  4644   HELENA. I like him well.
  4645   DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave
  4646     That leads him to these places; were I his lady
  4647     I would poison that vile rascal.
  4648   HELENA. Which is he?
  4649   DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
  4650   HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.
  4651   PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.
  4652   MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something.
  4653     Look, he has spied us.
  4654   WIDOW. Marry, hang you!
  4655   MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
  4656                               Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY
  4657   WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
  4658     Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents
  4659     There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
  4660     Already at my house.
  4661   HELENA. I humbly thank you.
  4662     Please it this matron and this gentle maid
  4663     To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking
  4664     Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,
  4665     I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,
  4666     Worthy the note.
  4667     BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.                   Exeunt
  4668

  4670 
  4671 
  4672 ACT III. SCENE 6.
  4673 Camp before Florence
  4674 
  4675 Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS
  4676 
  4677   SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
  4678   FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more
  4679     in your respect.
  4680   SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.
  4681   BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
  4682   SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
  4683     without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a
  4684     most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
  4685     promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
  4686     lordship's entertainment.
  4687   FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
  4688     virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty
  4689     business in a main danger fail you.
  4690   BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
  4691   FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which
  4692     you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
  4693   SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise
  4694     him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.
  4695     We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
  4696     but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
  4697     we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at
  4698     his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in
  4699     the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
  4700     deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that
  4701     with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
  4702     judgment in anything.
  4703   FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he
  4704     says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom
  4705     of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
  4706     ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
  4707     entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.
  4708 
  4709                       Enter PAROLLES
  4710 
  4711   SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of
  4712     his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.
  4713   BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your
  4714     disposition.
  4715   FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
  4716   PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was
  4717     excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own
  4718     wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
  4719   FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
  4720     service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
  4721     have prevented, if he had been there to command.
  4722   BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
  4723     Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
  4724     be recovered.
  4725   PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.
  4726   BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.
  4727   PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is
  4728     seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have
  4729     that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'
  4730   BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think
  4731     your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
  4732     again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,
  4733     and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you
  4734     speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
  4735     you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost
  4736     syllable of our worthiness.
  4737   PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
  4738   BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.
  4739   PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen
  4740     down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself
  4741     into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further
  4742     from me.
  4743   BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
  4744   PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the
  4745     attempt I vow.
  4746   BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership,
  4747     will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
  4748   PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit
  4749   SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange
  4750     fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
  4751     business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
  4752     and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
  4753   FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is
  4754     that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week
  4755     escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,
  4756     you have him ever after.
  4757   BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
  4758     so seriously he does address himself unto?
  4759   SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and
  4760     clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost
  4761     emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is
  4762     not for your lordship's respect.
  4763   FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
  4764     He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and
  4765     he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you
  4766     shall see this very night.
  4767   SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.
  4768   BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.
  4769   SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit
  4770   BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
  4771     The lass I spoke of.
  4772   FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.
  4773   BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,
  4774     And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
  4775     By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
  4776     Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
  4777     And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
  4778     Will you go see her?
  4779   FIRST LORD. With all my heart, my lord.                 Exeunt
  4780

  4784 ACT III. SCENE 7.
  4785 Florence. The WIDOW'S house
  4786 
  4787 Enter HELENA and WIDOW
  4788 
  4789   HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
  4790     I know not how I shall assure you further
  4791     But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
  4792   WIDOW. Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
  4793     Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
  4794     And would not put my reputation now
  4795     In any staining act.
  4796   HELENA. Nor would I wish you.
  4797   FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband,
  4798     And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
  4799     Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
  4800     By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
  4801     Err in bestowing it.
  4802   WIDOW. I should believe you;
  4803     For you have show'd me that which well approves
  4804     Y'are great in fortune.
  4805   HELENA. Take this purse of gold,
  4806     And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
  4807     Which I will over-pay and pay again
  4808     When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter
  4809     Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
  4810     Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
  4811     As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
  4812     Now his important blood will nought deny
  4813     That she'll demand. A ring the County wears
  4814     That downward hath succeeded in his house
  4815     From son to son some four or five descents
  4816     Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
  4817     In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
  4818     To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
  4819     Howe'er repented after.
  4820   WIDOW. Now I see
  4821     The bottom of your purpose.
  4822   HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more
  4823     But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
  4824     Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
  4825     In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
  4826     Herself most chastely absent. After this,
  4827     To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
  4828     To what is pass'd already.
  4829   WIDOW. I have yielded.
  4830     Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
  4831     That time and place with this deceit so lawful
  4832     May prove coherent. Every night he comes
  4833     With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd
  4834     To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
  4835     To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
  4836     As if his life lay on 't.
  4837   HELENA. Why then to-night
  4838     Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
  4839     Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
  4840     And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
  4841     Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
  4842     But let's about it.                                   Exeunt

  4858 ACT IV. SCENE 1.
  4859 Without the Florentine camp
  4860 
  4861 Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush
  4862 
  4863   SECOND LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
  4864     When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;
  4865     though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must
  4866     not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we
  4867     must produce for an interpreter.
  4868   FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
  4869   SECOND LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
  4870   FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.
  4871   SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
  4872   FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.
  4873   SECOND LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
  4874     adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all
  4875     neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of
  4876     his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we
  4877     seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
  4878     gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must
  4879     seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two
  4880     hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
  4881 
  4882                          Enter PAROLLES
  4883 
  4884   PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time
  4885     enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a
  4886     very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me;
  4887     and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my
  4888     tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars
  4889     before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
  4890     tongue.
  4891   SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
  4892     guilty of.
  4893   PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
  4894     of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and
  4895     knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and
  4896     say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
  4897     They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I
  4898     dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put
  4899     you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of
  4900     Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
  4901   SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that
  4902     he is?
  4903   PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn,
  4904     or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
  4905   SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.
  4906   PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
  4907     stratagem.
  4908   SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.
  4909   PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.
  4910   SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.
  4911   PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-
  4912   SECOND LORD. How deep?
  4913   PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.
  4914   SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  4915   PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I
  4916     recover'd it.
  4917   SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]
  4918   PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!
  4919   SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
  4920   ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
  4921   PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.
  4922                                             [They blindfold him]
  4923   FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.
  4924   PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
  4925     And I shall lose my life for want of language.
  4926     If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
  4927     Italian, or French, let him speak to me;
  4928     I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
  4929   FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy
  4930     tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
  4931     seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
  4932   PAROLLES. O!
  4933   FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
  4934   SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
  4935   FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;
  4936     And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
  4937     To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
  4938     Something to save thy life.
  4939   PAROLLES. O, let me live,
  4940     And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
  4941     Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that
  4942     Which you will wonder at.
  4943   FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?
  4944   PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.
  4945   FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.
  4946     Come on; thou art granted space.
  4947                    Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within
  4948   SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
  4949     We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
  4950     Till we do hear from them.
  4951   SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.
  4952   SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselves-
  4953     Inform on that.
  4954   SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.
  4955   SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
  4956                                                           Exeunt

  4961 ACT IV. SCENE 2.
  4962 Florence. The WIDOW'S house
  4963 
  4964 Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
  4965 
  4966   BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.
  4967   DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.
  4968   BERTRAM. Titled goddess;
  4969     And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
  4970     In your fine frame hath love no quality?
  4971     If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
  4972     You are no maiden, but a monument;
  4973     When you are dead, you should be such a one
  4974     As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
  4975     And now you should be as your mother was
  4976     When your sweet self was got.
  4977   DIANA. She then was honest.
  4978   BERTRAM. So should you be.
  4979   DIANA. No.
  4980     My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
  4981     As you owe to your wife.
  4982   BERTRAM. No more o'that!
  4983     I prithee do not strive against my vows.
  4984     I was compell'd to her; but I love the
  4985     By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
  4986     Do thee all rights of service.
  4987   DIANA. Ay, so you serve us
  4988     Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
  4989     You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
  4990     And mock us with our bareness.
  4991   BERTRAM. How have I sworn!
  4992   DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
  4993     But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
  4994     What is not holy, that we swear not by,
  4995     But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:
  4996     If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
  4997     I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths
  4998     When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
  4999     To swear by him whom I protest to love
  5000     That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths
  5001     Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-
  5002     At least in my opinion.
  5003   BERTRAM. Change it, change it;
  5004     Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
  5005     And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
  5006     That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
  5007     But give thyself unto my sick desires,
  5008     Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
  5009     My love as it begins shall so persever.
  5010   DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
  5011     That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
  5012   BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
  5013     To give it from me.
  5014   DIANA. Will you not, my lord?
  5015   BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,
  5016     Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
  5017     Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
  5018     In me to lose.
  5019   DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:
  5020     My chastity's the jewel of our house,
  5021     Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
  5022     Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
  5023     In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
  5024     Brings in the champion Honour on my part
  5025     Against your vain assault.
  5026   BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;
  5027     My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
  5028     And I'll be bid by thee.
  5029   DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
  5030     I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
  5031     Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
  5032     When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
  5033     Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
  5034     My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
  5035     When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.
  5036     And on your finger in the night I'll put
  5037     Another ring, that what in time proceeds
  5038     May token to the future our past deeds.
  5039     Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
  5040     A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
  5041   BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
  5042  Exit
  5043   DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
  5044     You may so in the end.
  5045     My mother told me just how he would woo,
  5046     As if she sat in's heart; she says all men
  5047     Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
  5048     When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
  5049     When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
  5050     Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
  5051     Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin
  5052     To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit

  5057 ACT IV. SCENE 3.
  5058 The Florentine camp
  5059 
  5060 Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS
  5061 
  5062   SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?
  5063   FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something
  5064     in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd
  5065     almost into another man.
  5066   SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
  5067     so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
  5068   FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
  5069     of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to
  5070     him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
  5071     with you.
  5072   SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave
  5073     of it.
  5074   FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence,
  5075     of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in
  5076     the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring,
  5077     and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
  5078   SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,
  5079     what things are we!
  5080   FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of
  5081     all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
  5082     to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives
  5083     against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows
  5084     himself.
  5085   SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
  5086     unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
  5087   FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
  5088   SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his
  5089     company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own
  5090     judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
  5091   FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
  5092     presence must be the whip of the other.
  5093   SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?
  5094   FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.
  5095   SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
  5096   FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel
  5097     higher, or return again into France?
  5098   SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
  5099     of his counsel.
  5100   FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal
  5101     of his act.
  5102   SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his
  5103     house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
  5104     which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
  5105     accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
  5106     became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last
  5107     breath, and now she sings in heaven.
  5108   FIRST LORD. How is this justified?
  5109   SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
  5110     makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death
  5111     itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was
  5112     faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.
  5113   FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
  5114   SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
  5115     point, to the full arming of the verity.
  5116   FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
  5117   SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
  5118     losses!
  5119   FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
  5120     tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
  5121     him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.
  5122   SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
  5123     together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
  5124     not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by
  5125     our virtues.
  5126 
  5127                       Enter a MESSENGER
  5128 
  5129     How now? Where's your master?
  5130   SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken
  5131     a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The
  5132     Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.
  5133   SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were
  5134     more than they can commend.
  5135   FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.
  5136     Here's his lordship now.
  5137 
  5138                         Enter BERTRAM
  5139 
  5140     How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?
  5141   BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's
  5142     length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the
  5143     Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for
  5144     her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my
  5145     convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many
  5146     nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended
  5147     yet.
  5148   SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning
  5149     your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
  5150   BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
  5151     hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and
  5152     the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has
  5153     deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.
  5154   SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th'
  5155     stocks all night, poor gallant knave.
  5156   BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his
  5157     spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
  5158   SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry
  5159     him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like
  5160     a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to
  5161     Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
  5162     remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'
  5163     stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?
  5164   BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?
  5165   SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
  5166     face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must
  5167     have the patience to hear it.
  5168 
  5169                    Enter PAROLLES guarded, and
  5170                   FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter
  5171 
  5172   BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.
  5173   SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
  5174   FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
  5175     'em?
  5176   PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye
  5177     pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
  5178   FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.
  5179   SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
  5180   FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you
  5181     answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
  5182   PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.
  5183   FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is
  5184     strong.' What say you to that?
  5185   PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.
  5186     The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor
  5187     rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.
  5188   FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?
  5189   PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you
  5190     will.
  5191   BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
  5192   SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,
  5193     the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole
  5194     theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the
  5195     chape of his dagger.
  5196   FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
  5197     clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
  5198     apparel neatly.
  5199   FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  5200   PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or
  5201     thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
  5202   SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.
  5203   BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.
  5204   PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.
  5205   FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  5206   PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are
  5207     marvellous poor.
  5208   FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.'
  5209     What say you to that?
  5210   PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I
  5211     will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;
  5212     Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
  5213     Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own
  5214     company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each; so
  5215     that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not
  5216     to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the
  5217     snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
  5218     pieces.
  5219   BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?
  5220   SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
  5221     condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.
  5222   FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him
  5223     whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
  5224     reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
  5225     in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
  5226     well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say
  5227     you to this? What do you know of it?
  5228   PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the
  5229     inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
  5230   FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  5231   PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from
  5232     whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a
  5233     dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
  5234   BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his
  5235     brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
  5236   FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
  5237     camp?
  5238   PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
  5239   SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
  5240     lordship anon.
  5241   FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
  5242   PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
  5243     mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band.
  5244     I think I have his letter in my pocket.
  5245   FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.
  5246   PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it
  5247     is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
  5248   FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?
  5249   PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.
  5250   BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
  5251   SECOND LORD. Excellently.
  5252   FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
  5253     gold.'
  5254   PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an
  5255     advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
  5256     heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle
  5257     boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up
  5258     again.
  5259   FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
  5260   PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf
  5261     of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
  5262     lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all
  5263     the fry it finds.
  5264   BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!
  5265   FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
  5266     'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
  5267     After he scores, he never pays the score.
  5268     Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
  5269     He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.
  5270     And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
  5271     Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
  5272     For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
  5273     Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
  5274     Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
  5275                                                    PAROLLES.'
  5276   BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's
  5277     forehead.
  5278   FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
  5279     linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
  5280   BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a
  5281     cat to me.
  5282   FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
  5283     fain to hang you.
  5284   PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,
  5285     but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the
  5286     remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'
  5287     stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.
  5288   FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
  5289     therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to
  5290     his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
  5291     honesty?
  5292   PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes
  5293     and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of
  5294     oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie,
  5295     sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool.
  5296     Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and
  5297     in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about
  5298     him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have
  5299     but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything
  5300     that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
  5301     have he has nothing.
  5302   SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.
  5303   BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For
  5304     me, he's more and more a cat.
  5305   FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
  5306   PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
  5307     tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldier-ship
  5308     I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the
  5309     officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the
  5310     doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of
  5311     this I am not certain.
  5312   SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity
  5313     redeems him.
  5314   BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.
  5315   FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
  5316     to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
  5317   PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his
  5318     salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all
  5319     remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.
  5320   FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
  5321   FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?
  5322   FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?
  5323   PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as
  5324     the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He
  5325     excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one
  5326     of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry,
  5327     in coming on he has the cramp.
  5328   FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
  5329     the Florentine?
  5330   PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
  5331   FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his
  5332     pleasure.
  5333   PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of all drums!
  5334     Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of
  5335     that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger.
  5336     Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
  5337   FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.
  5338     The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the
  5339     secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
  5340     very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
  5341     you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.
  5342   PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
  5343   FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your
  5344     friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
  5345   BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.
  5346   FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.
  5347   SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.
  5348   FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am
  5349     for France.
  5350   SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
  5351     you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not
  5352     a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.
  5353                                         Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
  5354   FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that
  5355     has a knot on 't yet.
  5356   PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
  5357   FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were
  5358     that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent
  5359     nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of
  5360     you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
  5361   PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,
  5362     'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
  5363     But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft
  5364     As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
  5365     Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
  5366     Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
  5367     That every braggart shall be found an ass.
  5368     Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live
  5369     Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.
  5370     There's place and means for every man alive.
  5371     I'll after them.                                        Exit

  5380 
  5381   HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you!
  5382     One of the greatest in the Christian world
  5383     Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,
  5384     Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
  5385     Time was I did him a desired office,
  5386     Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
  5387     Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
  5388     And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
  5389     His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place
  5390     We have convenient convoy. You must know
  5391     I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
  5392     My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
  5393     And by the leave of my good lord the King,
  5394     We'll be before our welcome.
  5395   WIDOW. Gentle madam,
  5396     You never had a servant to whose trust
  5397     Your business was more welcome.
  5398   HELENA. Nor you, mistress,
  5399     Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
  5400     To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
  5401     Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
  5402     As it hath fated her to be my motive
  5403     And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
  5404     That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
  5405     When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
  5406     Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play
  5407     With what it loathes, for that which is away.
  5408     But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
  5409     Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
  5410     Something in my behalf.
  5411   DIANA. Let death and honesty
  5412     Go with your impositions, I am yours
  5413     Upon your will to suffer.
  5414   HELENA. Yet, I pray you:
  5415     But with the word the time will bring on summer,
  5416     When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
  5417     And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
  5418     Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.
  5419     All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the crown.
  5420     Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.           Exeunt

  5430   LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow
  5431     there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd
  5432     and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law
  5433     had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
  5434     advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak
  5435     of.
  5436   COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most
  5437     virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If
  5438     she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a
  5439     mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.
  5440   LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
  5441     sallets ere we light on such another herb.
  5442   CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or,
  5443     rather, the herb of grace.
  5444   LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
  5445   CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in
  5446     grass.
  5447   LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
  5448   CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
  5449   LAFEU. Your distinction?
  5450   CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
  5451   LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
  5452   CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
  5453   LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
  5454   CLOWN. At your service.
  5455   LAFEU. No, no, no.
  5456   CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
  5457     prince as you are.
  5458   LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?
  5459   CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more
  5460     hotter in France than there.
  5461   LAFEU. What prince is that?
  5462   CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
  5463     the devil.
  5464   LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest
  5465     thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
  5466   CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire;
  5467     and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he
  5468     is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I
  5469     am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too
  5470     little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but
  5471     the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the
  5472     flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  5473   LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee
  5474     so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
  5475     let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
  5476   CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'
  5477     tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
  5478  Exit
  5479   LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
  5480   COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport
  5481     out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is
  5482     a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs
  5483     where he will.
  5484   LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell
  5485     you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
  5486     your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to
  5487     speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
  5488     them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
  5489     first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to
  5490     stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there
  5491     is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
  5492   COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily
  5493     effected.
  5494   LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
  5495     when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
  5496     deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
  5497   COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
  5498     I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech
  5499     your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together.
  5500   LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
  5501     admitted.
  5502   COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.
  5503   LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my
  5504     God, it holds yet.
  5505 
  5506                          Re-enter CLOWN
  5507 
  5508   CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet
  5509     on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet
  5510     knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a
  5511     cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
  5512   LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of
  5513     honour; so belike is that.
  5514   CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.
  5515   LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;
  5516     I long to talk with the young noble soldier.
  5517   CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and
  5518     most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
  5519                                                           Exeunt

  5536 Marseilles. A street
  5537 
  5538 Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA, with two ATTENDANTS
  5539 
  5540   HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night
  5541     Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.
  5542     But since you have made the days and nights as one,
  5543     To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
  5544     Be bold you do so grow in my requital
  5545     As nothing can unroot you.
  5546 
  5547                       Enter a GENTLEMAN
  5548 
  5549     In happy time!
  5550     This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,
  5551     If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
  5552   GENTLEMAN. And you.
  5553   HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
  5554   GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.
  5555   HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n
  5556     From the report that goes upon your goodness;
  5557     And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
  5558     Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
  5559     The use of your own virtues, for the which
  5560     I shall continue thankful.
  5561   GENTLEMAN. What's your will?
  5562   HELENA. That it will please you
  5563     To give this poor petition to the King;
  5564     And aid me with that store of power you have
  5565     To come into his presence.
  5566   GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.
  5567   HELENA. Not here, sir?
  5568   GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.
  5569     He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
  5570     Than is his use.
  5571   WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!
  5572   HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,
  5573     Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
  5574     I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
  5575   GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
  5576     Whither I am going.
  5577   HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,
  5578     Since you are like to see the King before me,
  5579     Commend the paper to his gracious hand;
  5580     Which I presume shall render you no blame,
  5581     But rather make you thank your pains for it.
  5582     I will come after you with what good speed
  5583     Our means will make us means.
  5584   GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.
  5585   HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
  5586     Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again;
  5587     Go, go, provide.                                      Exeunt

  5592 ACT V SCENE 2.
  5593 Rousillon. The inner court of the COUNT'S palace
  5594 
  5595 Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES
  5596 
  5597   PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I
  5598     have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held
  5599     familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in
  5600     Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
  5601     displeasure.
  5602   CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell
  5603     so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish
  5604     of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.
  5605   PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by
  5606     a metaphor.
  5607   CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or
  5608     against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.
  5609   PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
  5610   CLOWN. Foh! prithee stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-stool
  5611     to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.
  5612 
  5613                            Enter LAFEU
  5614 
  5615     Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not
  5616     a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her
  5617     displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir,
  5618     use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
  5619     ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress
  5620     in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.
  5621  Exit
  5622   PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd.
  5623   LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her
  5624     nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that
  5625     she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would
  5626     not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for
  5627     you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for
  5628     other business.
  5629   PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
  5630   LAFEU. You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your
  5631     word.
  5632   PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
  5633   LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your
  5634     hand. How does your drum?
  5635   PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.
  5636   LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
  5637   PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for
  5638     you did bring me out.
  5639   LAFEU. Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the
  5640     office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the
  5641     other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I
  5642     know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had
  5643     talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you
  5644     shall eat. Go to; follow.
  5645   PAROLLES. I praise God for you.                         Exeunt

  5650 ACT V SCENE 3.
  5651 Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace
  5652 
  5653 Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS
  5654 
  5655   KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
  5656     Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
  5657     As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
  5658     Her estimation home.
  5659   COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;
  5660     And I beseech your Majesty to make it
  5661     Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of youth,
  5662     When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
  5663     O'erbears it and burns on.
  5664   KING. My honour'd lady,
  5665     I have forgiven and forgotten all;
  5666     Though my revenges were high bent upon him
  5667     And watch'd the time to shoot.
  5668   LAFEU. This I must say-
  5669     But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord
  5670     Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,
  5671     Offence of mighty note; but to himself
  5672     The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
  5673     Whose beauty did astonish the survey
  5674     Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;
  5675     Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
  5676     Humbly call'd mistress.
  5677   KING. Praising what is lost
  5678     Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
  5679     We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
  5680     All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;
  5681     The nature of his great offence is dead,
  5682     And deeper than oblivion do we bury
  5683     Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,
  5684     A stranger, no offender; and inform him
  5685     So 'tis our will he should.
  5686   GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
  5687   KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?
  5688   LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
  5689   KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
  5690     That sets him high in fame.
  5691 
  5692                           Enter BERTRAM
  5693 
  5694   LAFEU. He looks well on 't.
  5695   KING. I am not a day of season,
  5696     For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
  5697     In me at once. But to the brightest beams
  5698     Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
  5699     The time is fair again.
  5700   BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,
  5701     Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
  5702   KING. All is whole;
  5703     Not one word more of the consumed time.
  5704     Let's take the instant by the forward top;
  5705     For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
  5706     Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
  5707     Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
  5708     The daughter of this lord?
  5709   BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first
  5710     I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
  5711     Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;
  5712     Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
  5713     Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
  5714     Which warp'd the line of every other favour,
  5715     Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,
  5716     Extended or contracted all proportions
  5717     To a most hideous object. Thence it came
  5718     That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,
  5719     Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye
  5720     The dust that did offend it.
  5721   KING. Well excus'd.
  5722     That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
  5723     From the great compt; but love that comes too late,
  5724     Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
  5725     To the great sender turns a sour offence,
  5726     Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
  5727     Make trivial price of serious things we have,
  5728     Not knowing them until we know their grave.
  5729     Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
  5730     Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;
  5731     Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
  5732     While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
  5733     Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.
  5734     Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
  5735     The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
  5736     To see our widower's second marriage-day.
  5737   COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
  5738     Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
  5739   LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
  5740     Must be digested; give a favour from you,
  5741     To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
  5742     That she may quickly come.
  5743                                           [BERTRAM gives a ring]
  5744     By my old beard,
  5745     And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
  5746     Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,
  5747     The last that e'er I took her leave at court,
  5748     I saw upon her finger.
  5749   BERTRAM. Hers it was not.
  5750   KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
  5751     While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
  5752     This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen
  5753     I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
  5754     Necessitied to help, that by this token
  5755     I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
  5756     Of what should stead her most?
  5757   BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,
  5758     Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
  5759     The ring was never hers.
  5760   COUNTESS. Son, on my life,
  5761     I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
  5762     At her life's rate.
  5763   LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.
  5764   BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.
  5765     In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
  5766     Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
  5767     Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
  5768     I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd
  5769     To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully
  5770     I could not answer in that course of honour
  5771     As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,
  5772     In heavy satisfaction, and would never
  5773     Receive the ring again.
  5774   KING. Plutus himself,
  5775     That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
  5776     Hath not in nature's mystery more science
  5777     Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
  5778     Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
  5779     That you are well acquainted with yourself,
  5780     Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
  5781     You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety
  5782     That she would never put it from her finger
  5783     Unless she gave it to yourself in bed-
  5784     Where you have never come- or sent it us
  5785     Upon her great disaster.
  5786   BERTRAM. She never saw it.
  5787   KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
  5788     And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
  5789     Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
  5790     That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.
  5791     And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
  5792     And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
  5793     Her eyes myself, could win me to believe
  5794     More than to see this ring. Take him away.
  5795                                           [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]
  5796     My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
  5797     Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
  5798     Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.
  5799     We'll sift this matter further.
  5800   BERTRAM. If you shall prove
  5801     This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
  5802     Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
  5803     Where she yet never was.                       Exit, guarded
  5804   KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
  5805 
  5806                         Enter a GENTLEMAN
  5807 
  5808   GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,
  5809     Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
  5810     Here's a petition from a Florentine,
  5811     Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
  5812     To tender it herself. I undertook it,
  5813     Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
  5814     Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
  5815     Is here attending; her business looks in her
  5816     With an importing visage; and she told me
  5817     In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
  5818     Your Highness with herself.
  5819   KING.  [Reads the letter]  'Upon his many protestations to marry me
  5820     when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the
  5821     Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my
  5822     honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave,
  5823     and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King!
  5824     in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor
  5825     maid is undone.
  5826                                                 DIANA CAPILET.'
  5827   LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.
  5828     I'll none of him.
  5829   KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu,
  5830     To bring forth this discov'ry. Seek these suitors.
  5831     Go speedily, and bring again the Count.
  5832                                                Exeunt ATTENDANTS
  5833     I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
  5834     Was foully snatch'd.
  5835   COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!
  5836 
  5837                        Enter BERTRAM, guarded
  5838 
  5839   KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.
  5840     And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
  5841     Yet you desire to marry.
  5842                                            Enter WIDOW and DIANA
  5843     What woman's that?
  5844   DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
  5845     Derived from the ancient Capilet.
  5846     My suit, as I do understand, you know,
  5847     And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
  5848   WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
  5849     Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
  5850     And both shall cease, without your remedy.
  5851   KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?
  5852   BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny
  5853     But that I know them. Do they charge me further?
  5854   DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
  5855   BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.
  5856   DIANA. If you shall marry,
  5857     You give away this hand, and that is mine;
  5858     You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
  5859     You give away myself, which is known mine;
  5860     For I by vow am so embodied yours
  5861     That she which marries you must marry me,
  5862     Either both or none.
  5863   LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for
  5864     my daughter; you are no husband for her.
  5865   BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature
  5866     Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness
  5867     Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
  5868     Than for to think that I would sink it here.
  5869   KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
  5870     Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour
  5871     Than in my thought it lies!
  5872   DIANA. Good my lord,
  5873     Ask him upon his oath if he does think
  5874     He had not my virginity.
  5875   KING. What say'st thou to her?
  5876   BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,
  5877     And was a common gamester to the camp.
  5878   DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so
  5879     He might have bought me at a common price.
  5880     Do not believe him. o, behold this ring,
  5881     Whose high respect and rich validity
  5882     Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,
  5883     He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,
  5884     If I be one.
  5885   COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.
  5886     Of six preceding ancestors, that gem
  5887     Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,
  5888     Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:
  5889     That ring's a thousand proofs.
  5890   KING. Methought you said
  5891     You saw one here in court could witness it.
  5892   DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
  5893     So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.
  5894   LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
  5895   KING. Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT
  5896   BERTRAM. What of him?
  5897     He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
  5898     With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,
  5899     Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
  5900     Am I or that or this for what he'll utter
  5901     That will speak anything?
  5902   KING. She hath that ring of yours.
  5903   BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,
  5904     And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
  5905     She knew her distance, and did angle for me,
  5906     Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
  5907     As all impediments in fancy's course
  5908     Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
  5909     Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
  5910     Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;
  5911     And I had that which any inferior might
  5912     At market-price have bought.
  5913   DIANA. I must be patient.
  5914     You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
  5915     May justly diet me. I pray you yet-
  5916     Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-
  5917     Send for your ring, I will return it home,
  5918     And give me mine again.
  5919   BERTRAM. I have it not.
  5920   KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?
  5921   DIANA. Sir, much like
  5922     The same upon your finger.
  5923   KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.
  5924   DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.
  5925   KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him
  5926     Out of a casement.
  5927   DIANA. I have spoke the truth.
  5928 
  5929                        Enter PAROLLES
  5930 
  5931   BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
  5932   KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.
  5933     Is this the man you speak of?
  5934   DIANA. Ay, my lord.
  5935   KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,
  5936     Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
  5937     Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-
  5938     By him and by this woman here what know you?
  5939   PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable
  5940     gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.
  5941   KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?
  5942   PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
  5943   KING. How, I pray you?
  5944   PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
  5945   KING. How is that?
  5946   PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
  5947   KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.
  5948     What an equivocal companion is this!
  5949   PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.
  5950   LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
  5951   DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?
  5952   PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
  5953   KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
  5954   PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I
  5955     said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for
  5956     her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know
  5957     not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I
  5958     knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising
  5959     her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak
  5960     of; therefore I will not speak what I know.
  5961   KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are
  5962     married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand
  5963     aside.
  5964     This ring, you say, was yours?
  5965   DIANA. Ay, my good lord.
  5966   KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
  5967   DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
  5968   KING. Who lent it you?
  5969   DIANA. It was not lent me neither.
  5970   KING. Where did you find it then?
  5971   DIANA. I found it not.
  5972   KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,
  5973     How could you give it him?
  5974   DIANA. I never gave it him.
  5975   LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at
  5976     pleasure.
  5977   KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.
  5978   DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
  5979   KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;
  5980     To prison with her. And away with him.
  5981     Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
  5982     Thou diest within this hour.
  5983   DIANA. I'll never tell you.
  5984   KING. Take her away.
  5985   DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.
  5986   KING. I think thee now some common customer.
  5987   DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
  5988   KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
  5989   DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
  5990     He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:
  5991     I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
  5992     Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;
  5993     I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
  5994                                              [Pointing to LAFEU]
  5995   KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.
  5996   DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;
  5997                                                       Exit WIDOW
  5998     The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
  5999     And he shall surety me. But for this lord
  6000     Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
  6001     Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
  6002     He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
  6003     And at that time he got his wife with child.
  6004     Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
  6005     So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
  6006     And now behold the meaning.
  6007 
  6008                      Re-enter WIDOW with HELENA
  6009 
  6010   KING. Is there no exorcist
  6011     Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
  6012     Is't real that I see?
  6013   HELENA. No, my good lord;
  6014     'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
  6015     The name and not the thing.
  6016   BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!
  6017   HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
  6018     I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
  6019     And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:
  6020     'When from my finger you can get this ring,
  6021     And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.
  6022     Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
  6023   BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
  6024     I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
  6025   HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue,
  6026     Deadly divorce step between me and you!
  6027     O my dear mother, do I see you living?
  6028   LAFEU. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [To PAROLLES]
  6029     Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I
  6030     thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee;
  6031     let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.
  6032   KING. Let us from point to point this story know,
  6033     To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
  6034     [To DIANA]  If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,
  6035     Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
  6036     For I can guess that by thy honest aid
  6037     Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.-
  6038     Of that and all the progress, more and less,
  6039     Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
  6040     All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
  6041     The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.       [Flourish]
  6042 
  6043 EPILOGUE
  6044                              EPILOGUE.
  6045 
  6046   KING. The King's a beggar, now the play is done.
  6047     All is well ended if this suit be won,
  6048     That you express content; which we will pay
  6049     With strife to please you, day exceeding day.
  6050     Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
  6051     Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
  6052                                                     Exeunt omnes

  6136 SCENE:
  6137 The Roman Empire
  6138 
  6139 ACT I. SCENE I.
  6140 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  6141 
  6142 Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
  6143 
  6144   PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's
  6145     O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
  6146     That o'er the files and musters of the war
  6147     Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
  6148     The office and devotion of their view
  6149     Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
  6150     Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
  6151     The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
  6152     And is become the bellows and the fan
  6153     To cool a gipsy's lust.
  6154 
  6155      Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,
  6156                     with eunuchs fanning her
  6157 
  6158     Look where they come!
  6159     Take but good note, and you shall see in him
  6160     The triple pillar of the world transform'd
  6161     Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.
  6162   CLEOPATRA. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
  6163   ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
  6164   CLEOPATRA. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
  6165   ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
  6166 
  6167                        Enter a MESSENGER
  6168 
  6169   MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.
  6170   ANTONY. Grates me the sum.
  6171   CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony.
  6172     Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
  6173     If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
  6174     His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
  6175     Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
  6176     Perform't, or else we damn thee.'
  6177   ANTONY. How, my love?
  6178   CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like,
  6179     You must not stay here longer; your dismission
  6180     Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
  6181     Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
  6182     Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,
  6183     Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
  6184     Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
  6185     When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
  6186   ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
  6187     Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
  6188     Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
  6189     Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
  6190     Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
  6191     And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
  6192     On pain of punishment, the world to weet
  6193     We stand up peerless.
  6194   CLEOPATRA. Excellent falsehood!
  6195     Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
  6196     I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
  6197     Will be himself.
  6198   ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
  6199     Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
  6200     Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;
  6201     There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
  6202     Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
  6203   CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.
  6204   ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!
  6205     Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,
  6206     To weep; whose every passion fully strives
  6207     To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.
  6208     No messenger but thine, and all alone
  6209     To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
  6210     The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
  6211     Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.
  6212                      Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train
  6213   DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
  6214   PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
  6215     He comes too short of that great property
  6216     Which still should go with Antony.
  6217   DEMETRIUS. I am full sorry
  6218     That he approves the common liar, who
  6219     Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
  6220     Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt
  6221 
  6222 
  6223 
  6224 
  6225 SCENE II.
  6226 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  6227 
  6228 Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER
  6229 
  6230   CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
  6231     most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
  6232     to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
  6233     charge his horns with garlands!
  6234   ALEXAS. Soothsayer!
  6235   SOOTHSAYER. Your will?
  6236   CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
  6237   SOOTHSAYER. In nature's infinite book of secrecy
  6238     A little I can read.
  6239   ALEXAS. Show him your hand.
  6240 
  6241                        Enter ENOBARBUS
  6242 
  6243   ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
  6244     Cleopatra's health to drink.
  6245   CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.
  6246   SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.
  6247   CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.
  6248   SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  6249   CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.
  6250   IRAS. No, you shall paint when you are old.
  6251   CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!
  6252   ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
  6253   CHARMIAN. Hush!
  6254   SOOTHSAYER. You shall be more beloving than beloved.
  6255   CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
  6256   ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.
  6257   CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
  6258     three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
  6259     child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
  6260     marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
  6261   SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  6262   CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
  6263   SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
  6264     Than that which is to approach.
  6265   CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.
  6266     Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
  6267   SOOTHSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb,
  6268     And fertile every wish, a million.
  6269   CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
  6270   ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
  6271   CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
  6272   ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.
  6273   ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-
  6274     drunk to bed.
  6275   IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
  6276   CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
  6277   IRAS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
  6278   CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
  6279     cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
  6280   SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.
  6281   IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars.
  6282   SOOTHSAYER. I have said.
  6283   IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
  6284   CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
  6285     where would you choose it?
  6286   IRAS. Not in my husband's nose.
  6287   CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
  6288     fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
  6289     sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
  6290     worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
  6291     him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
  6292     me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
  6293     Isis, I beseech thee!
  6294   IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
  6295     it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
  6296     a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
  6297     dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
  6298   CHARMIAN. Amen.
  6299   ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
  6300     would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!
  6301 
  6302                           Enter CLEOPATRA
  6303 
  6304   ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony.
  6305   CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.
  6306   CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?
  6307   ENOBARBUS. No, lady.
  6308   CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?
  6309   CHARMIAN. No, madam.
  6310   CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
  6311     A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
  6312   ENOBARBUS. Madam?
  6313   CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
  6314   ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
  6315 
  6316           Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants
  6317 
  6318   CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.
  6319                        Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest
  6320   MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
  6321   ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?
  6322   MESSENGER. Ay.
  6323     But soon that war had end, and the time's state
  6324     Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
  6325     Whose better issue in the war from Italy
  6326     Upon the first encounter drave them.
  6327   ANTONY. Well, what worst?
  6328   MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.
  6329   ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
  6330     Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
  6331     Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
  6332     I hear him as he flatter'd.
  6333   MESSENGER. Labienus-
  6334     This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
  6335     Extended Asia from Euphrates,
  6336     His conquering banner shook from Syria
  6337     To Lydia and to Ionia,
  6338     Whilst-
  6339   ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.
  6340   MESSENGER. O, my lord!
  6341   ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
  6342     Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
  6343     Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
  6344     With such full licence as both truth and malice
  6345     Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
  6346     When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us
  6347     Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
  6348   MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
  6349   ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
  6350   FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
  6351   SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.
  6352   ANTONY. Let him appear.
  6353     These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
  6354     Or lose myself in dotage.
  6355 
  6356                  Enter another MESSENGER with a letter
  6357 
  6358     What are you?
  6359   SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.
  6360   ANTONY. Where died she?
  6361   SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.
  6362     Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
  6363     Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]
  6364   ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
  6365     There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
  6366     What our contempts doth often hurl from us
  6367     We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
  6368     By revolution low'ring, does become
  6369     The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
  6370     The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
  6371     I must from this enchanting queen break off.
  6372     Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
  6373     My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!
  6374 
  6375                     Re-enter ENOBARBUS
  6376 
  6377   ENOBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir?
  6378   ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.
  6379   ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
  6380     unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the
  6381     word.
  6382   ANTONY. I must be gone.
  6383   ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
  6384     to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
  6385     cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but
  6386     the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die
  6387     twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle
  6388     in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
  6389     celerity in dying.
  6390   ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.
  6391   ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
  6392     finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters
  6393     sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than
  6394     almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
  6395     makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
  6396   ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!
  6397   ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
  6398     work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
  6399     your travel.
  6400   ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
  6401   ENOBARBUS. Sir?
  6402   ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
  6403   ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?
  6404   ANTONY. Dead.
  6405   ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
  6406     pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it
  6407     shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
  6408     when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If
  6409     there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
  6410     and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with
  6411     consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and
  6412     indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
  6413   ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state
  6414     Cannot endure my absence.
  6415   ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
  6416     without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends
  6417     on your abode.
  6418   ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers
  6419     Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
  6420     The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
  6421     And get her leave to part. For not alone
  6422     The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
  6423     Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
  6424     Of many our contriving friends in Rome
  6425     Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
  6426     Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
  6427     The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
  6428     Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
  6429     Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
  6430     Pompey the Great and all his dignities
  6431     Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
  6432     Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
  6433     For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
  6434     The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding
  6435     Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
  6436     And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
  6437     To such whose place is under us, requires
  6438     Our quick remove from hence.
  6439   ENOBARBUS. I shall do't.                                Exeunt
  6440 
  6441 
  6442 
  6443 
  6444 SCENE III.
  6445 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  6446 
  6447 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
  6448 
  6449   CLEOPATRA. Where is he?
  6450   CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.
  6451   CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
  6452     I did not send you. If you find him sad,
  6453     Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
  6454     That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS
  6455   CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
  6456     You do not hold the method to enforce
  6457     The like from him.
  6458   CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
  6459   CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
  6460   CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
  6461   CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
  6462     In time we hate that which we often fear.
  6463 
  6464                             Enter ANTONY
  6465 
  6466     But here comes Antony.
  6467   CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.
  6468   ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
  6469   CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
  6470     It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
  6471     Will not sustain it.
  6472   ANTONY. Now, my dearest queen-
  6473   CLEOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.
  6474   ANTONY. What's the matter?
  6475   CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.
  6476     What says the married woman? You may go.
  6477     Would she had never given you leave to come!
  6478     Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
  6479     I have no power upon you; hers you are.
  6480   ANTONY. The gods best know-
  6481   CLEOPATRA. O, never was there queen
  6482     So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
  6483     I saw the treasons planted.
  6484   ANTONY. Cleopatra-
  6485   CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,
  6486     Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
  6487     Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
  6488     To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
  6489     Which break themselves in swearing!
  6490   ANTONY. Most sweet queen-
  6491   CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
  6492     But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
  6493     Then was the time for words. No going then!
  6494     Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
  6495     Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor
  6496     But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
  6497     Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
  6498     Art turn'd the greatest liar.
  6499   ANTONY. How now, lady!
  6500   CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
  6501     There were a heart in Egypt.
  6502   ANTONY. Hear me, queen:
  6503     The strong necessity of time commands
  6504     Our services awhile; but my full heart
  6505     Remains in use with you. Our Italy
  6506     Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
  6507     Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
  6508     Equality of two domestic powers
  6509     Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
  6510     Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
  6511     Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
  6512     Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
  6513     Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
  6514     And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
  6515     By any desperate change. My more particular,
  6516     And that which most with you should safe my going,
  6517     Is Fulvia's death.
  6518   CLEOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
  6519      It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?
  6520   ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.
  6521     Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
  6522     The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
  6523     See when and where she died.
  6524   CLEOPATRA. O most false love!
  6525     Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
  6526     With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
  6527     In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.
  6528   ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
  6529     The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
  6530     As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
  6531     That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
  6532     Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
  6533     As thou affects.
  6534   CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
  6535     But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-
  6536     So Antony loves.
  6537   ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,
  6538     And give true evidence to his love, which stands
  6539     An honourable trial.
  6540   CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.
  6541     I prithee turn aside and weep for her;
  6542     Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
  6543     Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
  6544     Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
  6545     Like perfect honour.
  6546   ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
  6547   CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
  6548   ANTONY. Now, by my sword-
  6549   CLEOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;
  6550     But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
  6551     How this Herculean Roman does become
  6552     The carriage of his chafe.
  6553   ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.
  6554   CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.
  6555     Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
  6556     Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.
  6557     That you know well. Something it is I would-
  6558     O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
  6559     And I am all forgotten!
  6560   ANTONY. But that your royalty
  6561     Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
  6562     For idleness itself.
  6563   CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour
  6564     To bear such idleness so near the heart
  6565     As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
  6566     Since my becomings kill me when they do not
  6567     Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;
  6568     Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
  6569     And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
  6570     Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
  6571     Be strew'd before your feet!
  6572   ANTONY. Let us go. Come.
  6573     Our separation so abides and flies
  6574     That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
  6575     And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
  6576     Away!                                                 Exeunt

  6581 SCENE IV.
  6582 Rome. CAESAR'S house
  6583 
  6584 Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train
  6585 
  6586   CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
  6587     It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
  6588     Our great competitor. From Alexandria
  6589     This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
  6590     The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
  6591     Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
  6592     More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
  6593     Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there
  6594     A man who is the abstract of all faults
  6595     That all men follow.
  6596   LEPIDUS. I must not think there are
  6597     Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
  6598     His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
  6599     More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
  6600     Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
  6601     Than what he chooses.
  6602   CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
  6603     Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
  6604     To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
  6605     And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
  6606     To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
  6607     With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
  6608     As his composure must be rare indeed
  6609     Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
  6610     No way excuse his foils when we do bear
  6611     So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
  6612     His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
  6613     Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
  6614     Call on him for't! But to confound such time
  6615     That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
  6616     As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
  6617     As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
  6618     Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
  6619     And so rebel to judgment.
  6620 
  6621                    Enter a MESSENGER
  6622 
  6623   LEPIDUS. Here's more news.
  6624   MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
  6625     Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
  6626     How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
  6627     And it appears he is belov'd of those
  6628     That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
  6629     The discontents repair, and men's reports
  6630     Give him much wrong'd.
  6631   CAESAR. I should have known no less.
  6632     It hath been taught us from the primal state
  6633     That he which is was wish'd until he were;
  6634     And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
  6635     Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
  6636     Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
  6637     Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
  6638     To rot itself with motion.
  6639   MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
  6640     Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
  6641     Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
  6642     With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
  6643     They make in Italy; the borders maritime
  6644     Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
  6645     No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
  6646     Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
  6647     Than could his war resisted.
  6648   CAESAR. Antony,
  6649     Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
  6650     Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
  6651     Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
  6652     Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
  6653     Though daintily brought up, with patience more
  6654     Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
  6655     The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
  6656     Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
  6657     The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
  6658     Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
  6659     The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps
  6660     It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
  6661     Which some did die to look on. And all this-
  6662     It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-
  6663     Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
  6664     So much as lank'd not.
  6665   LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.
  6666   CAESAR. Let his shames quickly
  6667     Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
  6668     Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
  6669     Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
  6670     Thrives in our idleness.
  6671   LEPIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,
  6672     I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
  6673     Both what by sea and land I can be able
  6674     To front this present time.
  6675   CAESAR. Till which encounter
  6676     It is my business too. Farewell.
  6677   LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
  6678     Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
  6679     To let me be partaker.
  6680   CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;
  6681     I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt
  6682 
  6683 
  6684 
  6685 
  6686 SCENE V.
  6687 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  6688 
  6689 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
  6690 
  6691   CLEOPATRA. Charmian!
  6692   CHARMIAN. Madam?
  6693   CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!
  6694     Give me to drink mandragora.
  6695   CHARMIAN. Why, madam?
  6696   CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
  6697     My Antony is away.
  6698   CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  6699   CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  6700   CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  6701   CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  6702   MARDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  6703   CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
  6704     In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
  6705     That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
  6706     May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
  6707   MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  6708   CLEOPATRA. Indeed?
  6709   MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
  6710     But what indeed is honest to be done.
  6711     Yet have I fierce affections, and think
  6712     What Venus did with Mars.
  6713   CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,
  6714     Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
  6715     Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
  6716     O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
  6717     Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
  6718     The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
  6719     And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
  6720     Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
  6721     For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
  6722     With most delicious poison. Think on me,
  6723     That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
  6724     And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
  6725     When thou wast here above the ground, I was
  6726     A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
  6727     Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
  6728     There would he anchor his aspect and die
  6729     With looking on his life.
  6730 
  6731                          Enter ALEXAS
  6732 
  6733   ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  6734   CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
  6735     Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
  6736     With his tinct gilded thee.
  6737     How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
  6738   ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
  6739     He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
  6740     This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
  6741   CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  6742   ALEXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
  6743     'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
  6744     This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
  6745     To mend the petty present, I will piece
  6746     Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
  6747     Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
  6748     And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
  6749     Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
  6750     Was beastly dumb'd by him.
  6751   CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  6752   ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
  6753     Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
  6754   CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
  6755     Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
  6756     He was not sad, for he would shine on those
  6757     That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
  6758     Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
  6759     In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
  6760     O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
  6761     The violence of either thee becomes,
  6762     So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
  6763   ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
  6764     Why do you send so thick?
  6765   CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day
  6766     When I forget to send to Antony
  6767     Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
  6768     Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
  6769     Ever love Caesar so?
  6770   CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  6771   CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
  6772     Say 'the brave Antony.'
  6773   CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  6774   CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  6775     If thou with Caesar paragon again
  6776     My man of men.
  6777   CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
  6778     I sing but after you.
  6779   CLEOPATRA. My salad days,
  6780     When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
  6781     To say as I said then. But come, away!
  6782     Get me ink and paper.
  6783     He shall have every day a several greeting,
  6784     Or I'll unpeople Egypt.                               Exeunt

  6800 ACT II. SCENE I.
  6801 Messina. POMPEY'S house
  6802 
  6803 Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner
  6804 
  6805   POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
  6806     The deeds of justest men.
  6807   MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
  6808     That what they do delay they not deny.
  6809   POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
  6810     The thing we sue for.
  6811   MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
  6812     Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs
  6813     Deny us for our good; so find we profit
  6814     By losing of our prayers.
  6815   POMPEY. I shall do well.
  6816     The people love me, and the sea is mine;
  6817     My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
  6818     Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
  6819     In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
  6820     No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
  6821     He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
  6822     Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
  6823     Nor either cares for him.
  6824   MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus
  6825     Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
  6826   POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
  6827   MENAS. From Silvius, sir.
  6828   POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
  6829     Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
  6830     Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
  6831     Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
  6832     Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
  6833     Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
  6834     Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
  6835     That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
  6836     Even till a Lethe'd dullness-
  6837 
  6838                        Enter VARRIUS
  6839 
  6840     How now, Varrius!
  6841   VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
  6842     Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
  6843     Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
  6844     A space for farther travel.
  6845   POMPEY. I could have given less matter
  6846     A better ear. Menas, I did not think
  6847     This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
  6848     For such a petty war; his soldiership
  6849     Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
  6850     The higher our opinion, that our stirring
  6851     Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
  6852     The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
  6853   MENAS. I cannot hope
  6854     Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
  6855     His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
  6856     His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
  6857     Not mov'd by Antony.
  6858   POMPEY. I know not, Menas,
  6859     How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
  6860     Were't not that we stand up against them all,
  6861     'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
  6862     For they have entertained cause enough
  6863     To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
  6864     May cement their divisions, and bind up
  6865     The petty difference we yet not know.
  6866     Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
  6867     Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
  6868     Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt
  6869 
  6870

  6873 SCENE II.
  6874 Rome. The house of LEPIDUS
  6875 
  6876 Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
  6877 
  6878   LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
  6879     And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
  6880     To soft and gentle speech.
  6881   ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him
  6882     To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
  6883     Let Antony look over Caesar's head
  6884     And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
  6885     Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
  6886     I would not shave't to-day.
  6887   LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time
  6888     For private stomaching.
  6889   ENOBARBUS. Every time
  6890     Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
  6891   LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
  6892   ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
  6893   LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion;
  6894     But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
  6895     The noble Antony.
  6896 
  6897                 Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
  6898 
  6899   ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.
  6900 
  6901             Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA
  6902 
  6903   ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
  6904     Hark, Ventidius.
  6905   CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  6906   LEPIDUS. Noble friends,
  6907     That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
  6908     A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
  6909     May it be gently heard. When we debate
  6910     Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
  6911     Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
  6912     The rather for I earnestly beseech,
  6913     Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
  6914     Nor curstness grow to th' matter.
  6915   ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.
  6916     Were we before our arinies, and to fight,
  6917     I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]
  6918   CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  6919   ANTONY. Thank you.
  6920   CAESAR. Sit.
  6921   ANTONY. Sit, sir.
  6922   CAESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  6923   ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
  6924     Or being, concern you not.
  6925   CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at
  6926     If, or for nothing or a little,
  6927     Should say myself offended, and with you
  6928     Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
  6929     Once name you derogately when to sound your name
  6930     It not concern'd me.
  6931   ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
  6932     What was't to you?
  6933   CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
  6934     Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there
  6935     Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
  6936     Might be my question.
  6937   ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  6938   CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
  6939     By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
  6940     Made wars upon me, and their contestation
  6941     Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
  6942   ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
  6943     Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
  6944     And have my learning from some true reports
  6945     That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
  6946     Discredit my authority with yours,
  6947     And make the wars alike against my stomach,
  6948     Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
  6949     Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
  6950     As matter whole you have not to make it with,
  6951     It must not be with this.
  6952   CAESAR. You praise yourself
  6953     By laying defects of judgment to me; but
  6954     You patch'd up your excuses.
  6955   ANTONY. Not so, not so;
  6956     I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
  6957     Very necessity of this thought, that I,
  6958     Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
  6959     Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
  6960     Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
  6961     I would you had her spirit in such another!
  6962     The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
  6963     You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
  6964   ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
  6965     wars with the women!
  6966   ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
  6967     Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
  6968     Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
  6969     Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
  6970     But say I could not help it.
  6971   CAESAR. I wrote to you
  6972     When rioting in Alexandria; you
  6973     Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
  6974     Did gibe my missive out of audience.
  6975   ANTONY. Sir,
  6976     He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
  6977     Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
  6978     Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day
  6979     I told him of myself, which was as much
  6980     As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
  6981     Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
  6982     Out of our question wipe him.
  6983   CAESAR. You have broken
  6984     The article of your oath, which you shall never
  6985     Have tongue to charge me with.
  6986   LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  6987   ANTONY. No;
  6988     Lepidus, let him speak.
  6989     The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
  6990     Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
  6991     The article of my oath-
  6992   CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
  6993     The which you both denied.
  6994   ANTONY. Neglected, rather;
  6995     And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
  6996     From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
  6997     I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
  6998     Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
  6999     Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
  7000     To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
  7001     For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
  7002     So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
  7003     To stoop in such a case.
  7004   LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  7005   MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
  7006     The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
  7007     Were to remember that the present need
  7008     Speaks to atone you.
  7009   LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  7010   ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
  7011     you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
  7012     You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
  7013     do.
  7014   ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  7015   ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  7016   ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  7017   ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  7018   CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
  7019     The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
  7020     We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
  7021     So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
  7022     What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
  7023     O' th' world, I would pursue it.
  7024   AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  7025   CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  7026   AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
  7027     Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
  7028     Is now a widower.
  7029   CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
  7030     If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
  7031     Were well deserv'd of rashness.
  7032   ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
  7033     Agrippa further speak.
  7034   AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
  7035     To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
  7036     With an unslipping knot, take Antony
  7037     Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
  7038     No worse a husband than the best of men;
  7039     Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
  7040     That which none else can utter. By this marriage
  7041     All little jealousies, which now seem great,
  7042     And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
  7043     Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
  7044     Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
  7045     Would each to other, and all loves to both,
  7046     Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
  7047     For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
  7048     By duty ruminated.
  7049   ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?
  7050   CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
  7051     With what is spoke already.
  7052   ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,
  7053     If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
  7054     To make this good?
  7055   CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and
  7056     His power unto Octavia.
  7057   ANTONY. May I never
  7058     To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
  7059     Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
  7060     Further this act of grace; and from this hour
  7061     The heart of brothers govern in our loves
  7062     And sway our great designs!
  7063   CAESAR. There is my hand.
  7064     A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
  7065     Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
  7066     To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
  7067     Fly off our loves again!
  7068   LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!
  7069   ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
  7070     For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
  7071     Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
  7072     Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
  7073     At heel of that, defy him.
  7074   LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.
  7075     Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
  7076     Or else he seeks out us.
  7077   ANTONY. Where lies he?
  7078   CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  7079   ANTONY. What is his strength by land?
  7080   CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
  7081     He is an absolute master.
  7082   ANTONY. So is the fame.
  7083     Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
  7084     Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
  7085     The business we have talk'd of.
  7086   CAESAR. With most gladness;
  7087     And do invite you to my sister's view,
  7088     Whither straight I'll lead you.
  7089   ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,
  7090     Not lack your company.
  7091   LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,
  7092     Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]
  7093                      Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS
  7094   MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  7095   ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
  7096     friend, Agrippa!
  7097   AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  7098   MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
  7099     digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
  7100   ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
  7101     the night light with drinking.
  7102   MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
  7103     twelve persons there. Is this true?
  7104   ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
  7105     monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
  7106   MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  7107   ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
  7108     upon the river of Cydnus.
  7109   AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
  7110     her.
  7111   ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.
  7112     The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
  7113     Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;
  7114     Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
  7115     The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
  7116     Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
  7117     The water which they beat to follow faster,
  7118     As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
  7119     It beggar'd all description. She did lie
  7120     In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,
  7121     O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
  7122     The fancy out-work nature. On each side her
  7123     Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
  7124     With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
  7125     To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
  7126     And what they undid did.
  7127   AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  7128   ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
  7129     So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
  7130     And made their bends adornings. At the helm
  7131     A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
  7132     Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
  7133     That yarely frame the office. From the barge
  7134     A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
  7135     Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
  7136     Her people out upon her; and Antony,
  7137     Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
  7138     Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
  7139     Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
  7140     And made a gap in nature.
  7141   AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  7142   ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
  7143     Invited her to supper. She replied
  7144     It should be better he became her guest;
  7145     Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
  7146     Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
  7147     Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
  7148     And for his ordinary pays his heart
  7149     For what his eyes eat only.
  7150   AGRIPPA. Royal wench!
  7151     She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
  7152     He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
  7153   ENOBARBUS. I saw her once
  7154     Hop forty paces through the public street;
  7155     And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
  7156     That she did make defect perfection,
  7157     And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.
  7158   MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  7159   ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.
  7160     Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
  7161     Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
  7162     The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
  7163     Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
  7164     Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
  7165     Bless her when she is riggish.
  7166   MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
  7167     The heart of Antony, Octavia is
  7168     A blessed lottery to him.
  7169   AGRIPPA. Let us go.
  7170     Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
  7171     Whilst you abide here.
  7172   ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.                    Exeunt

  7178 Rome. CAESAR'S house
  7179 
  7180 Enter ANTONY, CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them
  7181 
  7182   ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes
  7183     Divide me from your bosom.
  7184   OCTAVIA. All which time
  7185     Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
  7186     To them for you.
  7187   ANTONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,
  7188     Read not my blemishes in the world's report.
  7189     I have not kept my square; but that to come
  7190     Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady.
  7191   OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.
  7192   CAESAR. Good night.                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
  7193 
  7194                         Enter SOOTHSAYER
  7195 
  7196   ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
  7197   SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
  7198   ANTONY. If you can- your reason.
  7199   SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
  7200     yet hie you to Egypt again.
  7201   ANTONY. Say to me,
  7202     Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
  7203   SOOTHSAYER. Caesar's.
  7204     Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
  7205     Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
  7206     Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
  7207     Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
  7208     Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
  7209     Make space enough between you.
  7210   ANTONY. Speak this no more.
  7211   SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
  7212     If thou dost play with him at any game,
  7213     Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
  7214     He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
  7215     When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
  7216     Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
  7217     But, he away, 'tis noble.
  7218   ANTONY. Get thee gone.
  7219     Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
  7220                                                  Exit SOOTHSAYER
  7221     He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
  7222     He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
  7223     And in our sports my better cunning faints
  7224     Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
  7225     His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
  7226     When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
  7227     Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
  7228     And though I make this marriage for my peace,
  7229     I' th' East my pleasure lies.
  7230 
  7231                        Enter VENTIDIUS
  7232 
  7233     O, come, Ventidius,
  7234     You must to Parthia. Your commission's ready;
  7235     Follow me and receive't.                              Exeunt

  7242 
  7243 Enter LEPIDUS, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA
  7244 
  7245   LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
  7246     Your generals after.
  7247   AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
  7248     Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
  7249   LEPIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
  7250     Which will become you both, farewell.
  7251   MAECENAS. We shall,
  7252     As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
  7253     Before you, Lepidus.
  7254   LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter;
  7255     My purposes do draw me much about.
  7256     You'll win two days upon me.
  7257   BOTH. Sir, good success!
  7258   LEPIDUS. Farewell.                                      Exeunt

  7264 Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  7265 
  7266 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
  7267 
  7268   CLEOPATRA. Give me some music- music, moody food
  7269     Of us that trade in love.
  7270   ALL. The music, ho!
  7271 
  7272                     Enter MARDIAN the eunuch
  7273 
  7274   CLEOPATRA. Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
  7275   CHARMIAN. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
  7276   CLEOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
  7277     As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
  7278   MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.
  7279   CLEOPATRA. And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
  7280     The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.
  7281     Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,
  7282     My music playing far off, I will betray
  7283     Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
  7284     Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
  7285     I'll think them every one an Antony,
  7286     And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'
  7287   CHARMIAN. 'Twas merry when
  7288     You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
  7289     Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
  7290     With fervency drew up.
  7291   CLEOPATRA. That time? O times
  7292     I laughed him out of patience; and that night
  7293     I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
  7294     Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
  7295     Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
  7296     I wore his sword Philippan.
  7297 
  7298                     Enter a MESSENGER
  7299 
  7300     O! from Italy?
  7301     Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
  7302     That long time have been barren.
  7303   MESSENGER. Madam, madam-
  7304   CLEOPATRA. Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
  7305     Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
  7306     If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
  7307     My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings
  7308     Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
  7309   MESSENGER. First, madam, he is well.
  7310   CLEOPATRA. Why, there's more gold.
  7311     But, sirrah, mark, we use
  7312     To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
  7313     The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
  7314     Down thy ill-uttering throat.
  7315   MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.
  7316   CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will.
  7317     But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony
  7318     Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour
  7319     To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,
  7320     Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
  7321     Not like a formal man.
  7322   MESSENGER. Will't please you hear me?
  7323   CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
  7324     Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
  7325     Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
  7326     I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
  7327     Rich pearls upon thee.
  7328   MESSENGER. Madam, he's well.
  7329   CLEOPATRA. Well said.
  7330   MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.
  7331   CLEOPATRA. Th'art an honest man.
  7332   MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
  7333   CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.
  7334   MESSENGER. But yet, madam-
  7335   CLEOPATRA. I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
  7336     The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
  7337     'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
  7338     Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
  7339     Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
  7340     The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;
  7341     In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.
  7342   MESSENGER. Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
  7343     He's bound unto Octavia.
  7344   CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?
  7345   MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed.
  7346   CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.
  7347   MESSENGER. Madam, he's married to Octavia.
  7348   CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
  7349                                               [Strikes him down]
  7350   MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.
  7351   CLEOPATRA. What say you? Hence,                  [Strikes him]
  7352     Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
  7353     Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;
  7354                                      [She hales him up and down]
  7355     Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
  7356     Smarting in ling'ring pickle.
  7357   MESSENGER. Gracious madam,
  7358     I that do bring the news made not the match.
  7359   CLEOPATRA. Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
  7360     And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
  7361     Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
  7362     And I will boot thee with what gift beside
  7363     Thy modesty can beg.
  7364   MESSENGER. He's married, madam.
  7365   CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
  7366   MESSENGER. Nay, then I'll run.
  7367     What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.             Exit
  7368   CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
  7369     The man is innocent.
  7370   CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
  7371     Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
  7372     Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.
  7373     Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!
  7374   CHARMIAN. He is afear'd to come.
  7375   CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.
  7376     These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
  7377     A meaner than myself; since I myself
  7378     Have given myself the cause.
  7379 
  7380                     Enter the MESSENGER again
  7381 
  7382     Come hither, sir.
  7383     Though it be honest, it is never good
  7384     To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message
  7385     An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
  7386     Themselves when they be felt.
  7387   MESSENGER. I have done my duty.
  7388   CLEOPATRA. Is he married?
  7389     I cannot hate thee worser than I do
  7390     If thou again say 'Yes.'
  7391   MESSENGER. He's married, madam.
  7392   CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
  7393   MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?
  7394   CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst,
  7395     So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
  7396     A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
  7397     Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
  7398     Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
  7399   MESSENGER. I crave your Highness' pardon.
  7400   CLEOPATRA. He is married?
  7401   MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you;
  7402     To punish me for what you make me do
  7403     Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.
  7404   CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
  7405     That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.
  7406     The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
  7407     Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
  7408     And be undone by 'em!                         Exit MESSENGER
  7409   CHARMIAN. Good your Highness, patience.
  7410   CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
  7411   CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.
  7412   CLEOPATRA. I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
  7413     I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
  7414     Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
  7415     Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
  7416     Her inclination; let him not leave out
  7417     The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
  7418                                                      Exit ALEXAS
  7419     Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian-
  7420     Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
  7421     The other way's a Mars.                         [To MARDIAN]
  7422     Bid you Alexas
  7423     Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,
  7424     But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.        Exeunt
  7425 
  7426 
  7427 
  7428 
  7429 SCENE VI.
  7430 Near Misenum
  7431 
  7432 Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet;
  7433 at another, CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, ENOBARBUS, MAECENAS, AGRIPPA,
  7434 with soldiers marching
  7435 
  7436   POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
  7437     And we shall talk before we fight.
  7438   CAESAR. Most meet
  7439     That first we come to words; and therefore have we
  7440     Our written purposes before us sent;
  7441     Which if thou hast considered, let us know
  7442     If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
  7443     And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
  7444     That else must perish here.
  7445   POMPEY. To you all three,
  7446     The senators alone of this great world,
  7447     Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
  7448     Wherefore my father should revengers want,
  7449     Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
  7450     Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
  7451     There saw you labouring for him. What was't
  7452     That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
  7453     Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,
  7454     With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
  7455     To drench the Capitol, but that they would
  7456     Have one man but a man? And that is it
  7457     Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
  7458     The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
  7459     To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome
  7460     Cast on my noble father.
  7461   CAESAR. Take your time.
  7462   ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
  7463     We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st
  7464     How much we do o'er-count thee.
  7465   POMPEY. At land, indeed,
  7466     Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.
  7467     But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
  7468     Remain in't as thou mayst.
  7469   LEPIDUS. Be pleas'd to tell us-
  7470     For this is from the present- how you take
  7471     The offers we have sent you.
  7472   CAESAR. There's the point.
  7473   ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
  7474     What it is worth embrac'd.
  7475   CAESAR. And what may follow,
  7476     To try a larger fortune.
  7477   POMPEY. You have made me offer
  7478     Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
  7479     Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
  7480     Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
  7481     To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
  7482     Our targes undinted.
  7483   ALL. That's our offer.
  7484   POMPEY. Know, then,
  7485     I came before you here a man prepar'd
  7486     To take this offer; but Mark Antony
  7487     Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
  7488     The praise of it by telling, you must know,
  7489     When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
  7490     Your mother came to Sicily and did find
  7491     Her welcome friendly.
  7492   ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
  7493     And am well studied for a liberal thanks
  7494     Which I do owe you.
  7495   POMPEY. Let me have your hand.
  7496     I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
  7497   ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
  7498     That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
  7499     For I have gained by't.
  7500   CAESAR. Since I saw you last
  7501     There is a change upon you.
  7502   POMPEY. Well, I know not
  7503     What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
  7504     But in my bosom shall she never come
  7505     To make my heart her vassal.
  7506   LEPIDUS. Well met here.
  7507   POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
  7508     I crave our composition may be written,
  7509     And seal'd between us.
  7510   CAESAR. That's the next to do.
  7511   POMPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
  7512     Draw lots who shall begin.
  7513   ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.
  7514   POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot;
  7515     But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
  7516     Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
  7517     Grew fat with feasting there.
  7518   ANTONY. You have heard much.
  7519   POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.
  7520   ANTONY. And fair words to them.
  7521   POMPEY. Then so much have I heard;
  7522     And I have heard Apollodorus carried-
  7523   ENOBARBUS. No more of that! He did so.
  7524   POMPEY. What, I pray you?
  7525   ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
  7526   POMPEY. I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
  7527   ENOBARBUS. Well;
  7528     And well am like to do, for I perceive
  7529     Four feasts are toward.
  7530   POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand.
  7531     I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,
  7532     When I have envied thy behaviour.
  7533   ENOBARBUS. Sir,
  7534     I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
  7535     When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
  7536     As I have said you did.
  7537   POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness;
  7538     It nothing ill becomes thee.
  7539     Aboard my galley I invite you all.
  7540     Will you lead, lords?
  7541   ALL. Show's the way, sir.
  7542   POMPEY. Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
  7543   MENAS. [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
  7544     treaty.- You and I have known, sir.
  7545   ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.
  7546   MENAS. We have, sir.
  7547   ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.
  7548   MENAS. And you by land.
  7549   ENOBARBUS. I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it
  7550     cannot be denied what I have done by land.
  7551   MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.
  7552   ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
  7553     have been a great thief by sea.
  7554   MENAS. And you by land.
  7555   ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
  7556     Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two
  7557     thieves kissing.
  7558   MENAS. All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
  7559   ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
  7560   MENAS. No slander: they steal hearts.
  7561   ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.
  7562   MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
  7563     Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
  7564   ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
  7565   MENAS. Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
  7566     you, is he married to Cleopatra?
  7567   ENOBARBUS. Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
  7568   MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
  7569   ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
  7570   MENAS. Pray ye, sir?
  7571   ENOBARBUS. 'Tis true.
  7572   MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
  7573   ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
  7574     prophesy so.
  7575   MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
  7576     than the love of the parties.
  7577   ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems
  7578     to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
  7579     their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
  7580   MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?
  7581   ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He
  7582     will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia
  7583     blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is
  7584     the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
  7585     their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he
  7586     married but his occasion here.
  7587   MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
  7588     health for you.
  7589   ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.
  7590   MENAS. Come, let's away.                                Exeunt
  7591 
  7592 ACT_2|SC_7
  7593                            SCENE VII.
  7594              On board POMPEY'S galley, off Misenum
  7595 
  7596      Music plays. Enter two or three SERVANTS with a banquet
  7597 
  7598   FIRST SERVANT. Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
  7599     ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them
  7600     down.
  7601   SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-colour'd.
  7602   FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.
  7603   SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
  7604     cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself
  7605     to th' drink.
  7606   FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his
  7607     discretion.
  7608   SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men's
  7609     fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service
  7610     as a partizan I could not heave.
  7611   FIRST SERVANT. To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
  7612     to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully
  7613     disaster the cheeks.
  7614 
  7615            A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
  7616             POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS, ENOBARBUS, MENAS,
  7617                          with other CAPTAINS
  7618 
  7619   ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
  7620       Nile
  7621     By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know
  7622     By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
  7623     Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
  7624     The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
  7625     Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
  7626     And shortly comes to harvest.
  7627   LEPIDUS. Y'have strange serpents there.
  7628   ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.
  7629   LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
  7630     operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
  7631   ANTONY. They are so.
  7632   POMPEY. Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
  7633   LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
  7634   ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till
  7635     then.
  7636   LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are
  7637     very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.
  7638   MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
  7639   POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
  7640   MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
  7641       Captain,
  7642     And hear me speak a word.
  7643   POMPEY. [ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
  7644     This wine for Lepidus!
  7645   LEPIDUS. What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
  7646   ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
  7647     hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
  7648     organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements
  7649     once out of it, it transmigrates.
  7650   LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?
  7651   ANTONY. Of it own colour too.
  7652   LEPIDUS. 'Tis a strange serpent.
  7653   ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
  7654   CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?
  7655   ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
  7656     epicure.
  7657   POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
  7658       Away!
  7659     Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?
  7660   MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
  7661       me,
  7662     Rise from thy stool.
  7663   POMPEY. [Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks
  7664     aside] The matter?
  7665   MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
  7666   POMPEY. Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
  7667     Be jolly, lords.
  7668   ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,
  7669     Keep off them, for you sink.
  7670   MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
  7671   POMPEY. What say'st thou?
  7672   MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
  7673   POMPEY. How should that be?
  7674   MENAS. But entertain it,
  7675     And though you think me poor, I am the man
  7676     Will give thee all the world.
  7677   POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?
  7678   MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
  7679     Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;
  7680     Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
  7681     Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
  7682   POMPEY. Show me which way.
  7683   MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors,
  7684     Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
  7685     And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
  7686     All there is thine.
  7687   POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
  7688     And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
  7689     In thee't had been good service. Thou must know
  7690     'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
  7691     Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
  7692     Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,
  7693     I should have found it afterwards well done,
  7694     But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
  7695   MENAS. [Aside] For this,
  7696     I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
  7697     Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
  7698     Shall never find it more.
  7699   POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!
  7700   ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
  7701   ENOBARBUS. Here's to thee, Menas!
  7702   MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!
  7703   POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.
  7704   ENOBARBUS. There's a strong fellow, Menas.
  7705                [Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS]
  7706   MENAS. Why?
  7707   ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
  7708   MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
  7709     That it might go on wheels!
  7710   ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels.
  7711   MENAS. Come.
  7712   POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
  7713   ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
  7714     Here's to Caesar!
  7715   CAESAR. I could well forbear't.
  7716     It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
  7717     And it grows fouler.
  7718   ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time.
  7719   CAESAR. Possess it, I'll make answer.
  7720     But I had rather fast from all four days
  7721     Than drink so much in one.
  7722   ENOBARBUS. [To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
  7723     Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
  7724     And celebrate our drink?
  7725   POMPEY. Let's ha't, good soldier.
  7726   ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,
  7727     Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
  7728     In soft and delicate Lethe.
  7729   ENOBARBUS. All take hands.
  7730     Make battery to our ears with the loud music,
  7731     The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;
  7732     The holding every man shall bear as loud
  7733     As his strong sides can volley.
  7734                [Music plays. ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand]
  7735 
  7736                         THE SONG
  7737             Come, thou monarch of the vine,
  7738             Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
  7739             In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
  7740             With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd.
  7741             Cup us till the world go round,
  7742             Cup us till the world go round!
  7743 
  7744   CAESAR. What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
  7745     Let me request you off; our graver business
  7746     Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
  7747     You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
  7748     Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
  7749     Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
  7750     Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
  7751     Good Antony, your hand.
  7752   POMPEY. I'll try you on the shore.
  7753   ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
  7754   POMPEY. O Antony,
  7755     You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.
  7756     Come, down into the boat.
  7757   ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.
  7758                               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
  7759     Menas, I'll not on shore.
  7760   MENAS. No, to my cabin.
  7761     These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
  7762     Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
  7763     To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!
  7764                                   [Sound a flourish, with drums]
  7765   ENOBARBUS. Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.
  7766   MENAS. Hoo! Noble Captain, come.                        Exeunt
  7767 ACT_3|SC_1
  7768                      ACT III. SCENE I.
  7769                      A plain in Syria
  7770 
  7771        Enter VENTIDIUS, as it were in triumph, with SILIUS
  7772       and other Romans, OFFICERS and soldiers; the dead body
  7773                 of PACORUS borne before him
  7774 
  7775   VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
  7776     Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
  7777     Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
  7778     Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
  7779     Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
  7780   SILIUS. Noble Ventidius,
  7781     Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
  7782     The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
  7783     Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
  7784     The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
  7785     Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
  7786     Put garlands on thy head.
  7787   VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius,
  7788     I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
  7789     May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:
  7790     Better to leave undone than by our deed
  7791     Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
  7792     Caesar and Antony have ever won
  7793     More in their officer, than person. Sossius,
  7794     One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
  7795     For quick accumulation of renown,
  7796     Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.
  7797     Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
  7798     Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
  7799     The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
  7800     Than gain which darkens him.
  7801     I could do more to do Antonius good,
  7802     But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
  7803     Should my performance perish.
  7804   SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that
  7805     Without the which a soldier and his sword
  7806     Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?
  7807   VENTIDIUS. I'll humbly signify what in his name,
  7808     That magical word of war, we have effected;
  7809     How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
  7810     The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
  7811     We have jaded out o' th' field.
  7812   SILIUS. Where is he now?
  7813   VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
  7814     The weight we must convey with's will permit,
  7815     We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.
  7816                                                           Exeunt

  7819                             SCENE II. Rome. CAESAR'S house
  7820 
  7821         Enter AGRIPPA at one door, ENOBARBUS at another
  7822 
  7823   AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?
  7824   ENOBARBUS. They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
  7825     The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
  7826     To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
  7827     Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
  7828     With the green sickness.
  7829   AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
  7830   ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!
  7831   AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
  7832   ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
  7833   AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
  7834   ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
  7835   AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
  7836   ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
  7837   AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
  7838   ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.
  7839     Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
  7840     Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-
  7841     His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
  7842     Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
  7843   AGRIPPA. Both he loves.
  7844   ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets
  7845       within] So-
  7846     This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
  7847   AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
  7848 
  7849            Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
  7850 
  7851   ANTONY. No further, sir.
  7852   CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself;
  7853     Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
  7854     As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
  7855     Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
  7856     Let not the piece of virtue which is set
  7857     Betwixt us as the cement of our love
  7858     To keep it builded be the ram to batter
  7859     The fortress of it; for better might we
  7860     Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
  7861     This be not cherish'd.
  7862   ANTONY. Make me not offended
  7863     In your distrust.
  7864   CAESAR. I have said.
  7865   ANTONY. You shall not find,
  7866     Though you be therein curious, the least cause
  7867     For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
  7868     And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
  7869     We will here part.
  7870   CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
  7871     The elements be kind to thee and make
  7872     Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.
  7873   OCTAVIA. My noble brother!
  7874   ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,
  7875     And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
  7876   OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-
  7877   CAESAR. What, Octavia?
  7878   OCTAVIA. I'll tell you in your ear.
  7879   ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
  7880     Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather,
  7881     That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,
  7882     And neither way inclines.
  7883   ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
  7884   AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
  7885   ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a
  7886       horse;
  7887     So is he, being a man.
  7888   AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
  7889     When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
  7890     He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
  7891     When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
  7892   ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled
  7893       with a rheum;
  7894     What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
  7895     Believe't- till I weep too.
  7896   CAESAR. No, sweet Octavia,
  7897     You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
  7898     Out-go my thinking on you.
  7899   ANTONY. Come, sir, come;
  7900     I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
  7901     Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
  7902     And give you to the gods.
  7903   CAESAR. Adieu; be happy!
  7904   LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light
  7905     To thy fair way!
  7906   CAESAR. Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]
  7907   ANTONY. Farewell!                       Trumpets sound. Exeunt

  7910                           SCENE III.
  7911               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  7912 
  7913          Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
  7914 
  7915   CLEOPATRA. Where is the fellow?
  7916   ALEXAS. Half afeard to come.
  7917   CLEOPATRA. Go to, go to.
  7918 
  7919                 Enter the MESSENGER as before
  7920 
  7921     Come hither, sir.
  7922   ALEXAS. Good Majesty,
  7923     Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
  7924     But when you are well pleas'd.
  7925   CLEOPATRA. That Herod's head
  7926     I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,
  7927     Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
  7928   MESSENGER. Most gracious Majesty!
  7929   CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia?
  7930   MESSENGER. Ay, dread Queen.
  7931   CLEOPATRA. Where?
  7932   MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome
  7933     I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
  7934     Between her brother and Mark Antony.
  7935   CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?
  7936   MESSENGER. She is not, madam.
  7937   CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
  7938   MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
  7939   CLEOPATRA. That's not so good. He cannot like her long.
  7940   CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
  7941   CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
  7942     What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
  7943     If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
  7944   MESSENGER. She creeps.
  7945     Her motion and her station are as one;
  7946     She shows a body rather than a life,
  7947     A statue than a breather.
  7948   CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?
  7949   MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.
  7950   CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt
  7951     Cannot make better note.
  7952   CLEOPATRA. He's very knowing;
  7953     I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.
  7954     The fellow has good judgment.
  7955   CHARMIAN. Excellent.
  7956   CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.
  7957   MESSENGER. Madam,
  7958     She was a widow.
  7959   CLEOPATRA. Widow? Charmian, hark!
  7960   MESSENGER. And I do think she's thirty.
  7961   CLEOPATRA. Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
  7962   MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.
  7963   CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
  7964     Her hair, what colour?
  7965   MESSENGER. Brown, madam; and her forehead
  7966     As low as she would wish it.
  7967   CLEOPATRA. There's gold for thee.
  7968     Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
  7969     I will employ thee back again; I find thee
  7970     Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;
  7971     Our letters are prepar'd.                   Exeunt MESSENGER
  7972   CHARMIAN. A proper man.
  7973   CLEOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
  7974     That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
  7975     This creature's no such thing.
  7976   CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.
  7977   CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
  7978   CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
  7979     And serving you so long!
  7980   CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
  7981     But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
  7982     Where I will write. All may be well enough.
  7983   CHARMIAN. I warrant you, madam.                         Exeunt

  7986                           SCENE IV.
  7987                   Athens. ANTONY'S house
  7988 
  7989                  Enter ANTONY and OCTAVIA
  7990 
  7991   ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
  7992     That were excusable, that and thousands more
  7993     Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
  7994     New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
  7995     To public ear;
  7996     Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not
  7997     But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
  7998     He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
  7999     When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
  8000     Or did it from his teeth.
  8001   OCTAVIA. O my good lord,
  8002     Believe not all; or if you must believe,
  8003     Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
  8004     If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
  8005     Praying for both parts.
  8006     The good gods will mock me presently
  8007     When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'
  8008     Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
  8009     'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
  8010     Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way
  8011     'Twixt these extremes at all.
  8012   ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,
  8013     Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
  8014     Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,
  8015     I lose myself; better I were not yours
  8016     Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
  8017     Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady,
  8018     I'll raise the preparation of a war
  8019     Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
  8020     So your desires are yours.
  8021   OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord.
  8022     The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,
  8023     Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
  8024     As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
  8025     Should solder up the rift.
  8026   ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,
  8027     Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults
  8028     Can never be so equal that your love
  8029     Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
  8030     Choose your own company, and command what cost
  8031     Your heart has mind to.                               Exeunt

  8037              Enter ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting
  8038 
  8039   ENOBARBUS. How now, friend Eros!
  8040   EROS. There's strange news come, sir.
  8041   ENOBARBUS. What, man?
  8042   EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
  8043   ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success?
  8044   EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
  8045     presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the
  8046     glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters
  8047     he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
  8048     So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
  8049   ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
  8050     And throw between them all the food thou hast,
  8051     They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
  8052   EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
  8053     The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
  8054     And threats the throat of that his officer
  8055     That murd'red Pompey.
  8056   ENOBARBUS. Our great navy's rigg'd.
  8057   EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
  8058     My lord desires you presently; my news
  8059     I might have told hereafter.
  8060   ENOBARBUS. 'Twill be naught;
  8061     But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
  8062   EROS. Come, sir.                                        Exeunt

  8066                    Rome. CAESAR'S house
  8067 
  8068              Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS
  8069 
  8070   CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
  8071     In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:
  8072     I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
  8073     Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
  8074     Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
  8075     Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
  8076     And all the unlawful issue that their lust
  8077     Since then hath made between them. Unto her
  8078     He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
  8079     Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
  8080     Absolute queen.
  8081   MAECENAS. This in the public eye?
  8082   CAESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
  8083     His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
  8084     Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,
  8085     He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
  8086     Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
  8087     In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
  8088     That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
  8089     As 'tis reported, so.
  8090   MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus
  8091     Inform'd.
  8092   AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence
  8093     Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
  8094   CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
  8095     His accusations.
  8096   AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?
  8097   CAESAR. Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
  8098     Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
  8099     His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
  8100     Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
  8101     That Lepidus of the triumvirate
  8102     Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
  8103     All his revenue.
  8104   AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
  8105   CAESAR. 'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
  8106     I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
  8107     That he his high authority abus'd,
  8108     And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
  8109     I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
  8110     And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
  8111     Demand the like.
  8112   MAECENAS. He'll never yield to that.
  8113   CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  8114 
  8115                 Enter OCTAVIA, with her train
  8116 
  8117   OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
  8118   CAESAR. That ever I should call thee cast-away!
  8119   OCTAVIA. You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
  8120   CAESAR. Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
  8121     Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
  8122     Should have an army for an usher, and
  8123     The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
  8124     Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
  8125     Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
  8126     Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
  8127     Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
  8128     Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
  8129     A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
  8130     The ostentation of our love, which left unshown
  8131     Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you
  8132     By sea and land, supplying every stage
  8133     With an augmented greeting.
  8134   OCTAVIA. Good my lord,
  8135     To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
  8136     On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
  8137     Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
  8138     My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd
  8139     His pardon for return.
  8140   CAESAR. Which soon he granted,
  8141     Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
  8142   OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.
  8143   CAESAR. I have eyes upon him,
  8144     And his affairs come to me on the wind.
  8145     Where is he now?
  8146   OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.
  8147   CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
  8148     Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
  8149     Up to a whore, who now are levying
  8150     The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled
  8151     Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
  8152     Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
  8153     Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
  8154     King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
  8155     Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
  8156     Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
  8157     The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with
  8158     More larger list of sceptres.
  8159   OCTAVIA. Ay me most wretched,
  8160     That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,
  8161     That does afflict each other!
  8162   CAESAR. Welcome hither.
  8163     Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
  8164     Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
  8165     And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
  8166     Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
  8167     O'er your content these strong necessities,
  8168     But let determin'd things to destiny
  8169     Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
  8170     Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
  8171     Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
  8172     To do you justice, make their ministers
  8173     Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
  8174     And ever welcome to us.
  8175   AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.
  8176   MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam.
  8177     Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
  8178     Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
  8179     In his abominations, turns you off,
  8180     And gives his potent regiment to a trull
  8181     That noises it against us.
  8182   OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?
  8183   CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
  8184     Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!         Exeunt

  8189 
  8190                 Enter CLEOPATRA and ENOBARBUS
  8191 
  8192   CLEOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
  8193   ENOBARBUS. But why, why,
  8194   CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
  8195     And say'st it is not fit.
  8196   ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?
  8197   CLEOPATRA. Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
  8198     Be there in person?
  8199   ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Well, I could reply:
  8200     If we should serve with horse and mares together
  8201     The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
  8202     A soldier and his horse.
  8203   CLEOPATRA. What is't you say?
  8204   ENOBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
  8205     Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,
  8206     What should not then be spar'd. He is already
  8207     Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
  8208     That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
  8209     Manage this war.
  8210   CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
  8211     That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
  8212     And, as the president of my kingdom, will
  8213     Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;
  8214     I will not stay behind.
  8215 
  8216                    Enter ANTONY and CANIDIUS
  8217 
  8218   ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done.
  8219     Here comes the Emperor.
  8220   ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
  8221     That from Tarentum and Brundusium
  8222     He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
  8223     And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?
  8224   CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admir'd
  8225     Than by the negligent.
  8226   ANTONY. A good rebuke,
  8227     Which might have well becom'd the best of men
  8228     To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
  8229     Will fight with him by sea.
  8230   CLEOPATRA. By sea! What else?
  8231   CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?
  8232   ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.
  8233   ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
  8234   CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
  8235     Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
  8236     Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
  8237     And so should you.
  8238   ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well mann'd;
  8239     Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
  8240     Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet
  8241     Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;
  8242     Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace
  8243     Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
  8244     Being prepar'd for land.
  8245   ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
  8246   ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
  8247     The absolute soldiership you have by land;
  8248     Distract your army, which doth most consist
  8249     Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
  8250     Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo
  8251     The way which promises assurance; and
  8252     Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
  8253     From firm security.
  8254   ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.
  8255   CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
  8256   ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
  8257     And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
  8258     Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
  8259     We then can do't at land.
  8260 
  8261                        Enter a MESSENGER
  8262 
  8263     Thy business?
  8264   MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
  8265     Caesar has taken Toryne.
  8266   ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
  8267     Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
  8268     Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
  8269     And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
  8270     Away, my Thetis!
  8271 
  8272                        Enter a SOLDIER
  8273 
  8274     How now, worthy soldier?
  8275   SOLDIER. O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
  8276     Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
  8277     This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians
  8278     And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
  8279     Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth
  8280     And fighting foot to foot.
  8281   ANTONY. Well, well- away.
  8282                          Exeunt ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, and ENOBARBUS
  8283   SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
  8284   CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
  8285     Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
  8286     And we are women's men.
  8287   SOLDIER. You keep by land
  8288     The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
  8289   CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
  8290     Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
  8291     But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
  8292     Carries beyond belief.
  8293   SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome,
  8294     His power went out in such distractions as
  8295     Beguil'd all spies.
  8296   CANIDIUS. Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
  8297   SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.
  8298   CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.
  8299 
  8300                         Enter a MESSENGER
  8301 
  8302   MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.
  8303   CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth
  8304     Each minute some.                                     Exeunt

  8310              Enter CAESAR, with his army, marching
  8311 
  8312   CAESAR. Taurus!
  8313   TAURUS. My lord?
  8314   CAESAR. Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle
  8315     Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
  8316     The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies
  8317     Upon this jump.                                       Exeunt

  8325   ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
  8326     In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
  8327     We may the number of the ships behold,
  8328     And so proceed accordingly.                           Exeunt

  8334         CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way
  8335         over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of
  8336       CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard
  8337                    the noise of a sea-fight
  8338 
  8339                     Alarum. Enter ENOBARBUS
  8340 
  8341   ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
  8342     Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
  8343     With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
  8344     To see't mine eyes are blasted.
  8345 
  8346                         Enter SCARUS
  8347 
  8348   SCARUS. Gods and goddesses,
  8349     All the whole synod of them!
  8350   ENOBARBUS. What's thy passion?
  8351   SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost
  8352     With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
  8353     Kingdoms and provinces.
  8354   ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight?
  8355   SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence,
  8356     Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
  8357     Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,
  8358     When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
  8359     Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-
  8360     The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
  8361     Hoists sails and flies.
  8362   ENOBARBUS. That I beheld;
  8363     Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
  8364     Endure a further view.
  8365   SCARUS. She once being loof'd,
  8366     The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
  8367     Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
  8368     Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
  8369     I never saw an action of such shame;
  8370     Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
  8371     Did violate so itself.
  8372   ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!
  8373 
  8374                        Enter CANIDIUS
  8375 
  8376   CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
  8377     And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
  8378     Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
  8379     O, he has given example for our flight
  8380     Most grossly by his own!
  8381   ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts?
  8382     Why then, good night indeed.
  8383   CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
  8384   SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
  8385     What further comes.
  8386   CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render
  8387     My legions and my horse; six kings already
  8388     Show me the way of yielding.
  8389   ENOBARBUS. I'll yet follow
  8390     The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
  8391     Sits in the wind against me.                          Exeunt

  8395               Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  8396 
  8397                Enter ANTONY With attendants
  8398 
  8399   ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
  8400     It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.
  8401     I am so lated in the world that I
  8402     Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship
  8403     Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,
  8404     And make your peace with Caesar.
  8405   ALL. Fly? Not we!
  8406   ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
  8407     To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
  8408     I have myself resolv'd upon a course
  8409     Which has no need of you; be gone.
  8410     My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
  8411     I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
  8412     My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
  8413     Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
  8414     For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
  8415     Have letters from me to some friends that will
  8416     Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
  8417     Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
  8418     Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
  8419     Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
  8420     I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
  8421     Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;
  8422     Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;
  8423     Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.    [Sits down]
  8424 
  8425             Enter CLEOPATRA, led by CHARMIAN and IRAS,
  8426                          EROS following
  8427 
  8428   EROS. Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.
  8429   IRAS. Do, most dear Queen.
  8430   CHARMIAN. Do? Why, what else?
  8431   CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!
  8432   ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.
  8433   EROS. See you here, sir?
  8434   ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
  8435   CHARMIAN. Madam!
  8436   IRAS. Madam, O good Empress!
  8437   EROS. Sir, sir!
  8438   ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
  8439     His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck
  8440     The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
  8441     That the mad Brutus ended; he alone
  8442     Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had
  8443     In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter.
  8444   CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by!
  8445   EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
  8446   IRAS. Go to him, madam, speak to him.
  8447     He is unqualitied with very shame.
  8448   CLEOPATRA. Well then, sustain me. O!
  8449  EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches.
  8450     Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but
  8451     Your comfort makes the rescue.
  8452   ANTONY. I have offended reputation-
  8453     A most unnoble swerving.
  8454   EROS. Sir, the Queen.
  8455   ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
  8456     How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
  8457     By looking back what I have left behind
  8458     'Stroy'd in dishonour.
  8459   CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord,
  8460     Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
  8461     You would have followed.
  8462   ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
  8463     My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,
  8464     And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit
  8465     Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
  8466     Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
  8467     Command me.
  8468   CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon!
  8469   ANTONY. Now I must
  8470     To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
  8471     And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
  8472     With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,
  8473     Making and marring fortunes. You did know
  8474     How much you were my conqueror, and that
  8475     My sword, made weak by my affection, would
  8476     Obey it on all cause.
  8477   CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!
  8478   ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
  8479     All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;
  8480     Even this repays me.
  8481     We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?
  8482     Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,
  8483     Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
  8484     We scorn her most when most she offers blows.         Exeunt

  8487                          SCENE XII.
  8488                    CAESAR'S camp in Egypt
  8489 
  8490    Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others
  8491 
  8492   CAESAR. Let him appear that's come from Antony.
  8493     Know you him?
  8494   DOLABELLA. Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
  8495     An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
  8496     He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
  8497     Which had superfluous kings for messengers
  8498     Not many moons gone by.
  8499 
  8500             Enter EUPHRONIUS, Ambassador from ANTONY
  8501 
  8502   CAESAR. Approach, and speak.
  8503   EUPHRONIUS. Such as I am, I come from Antony.
  8504     I was of late as petty to his ends
  8505     As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
  8506     To his grand sea.
  8507   CAESAR. Be't so. Declare thine office.
  8508   EUPHRONIUS. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
  8509     Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
  8510     He lessens his requests and to thee sues
  8511     To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
  8512     A private man in Athens. This for him.
  8513     Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
  8514     Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
  8515     The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
  8516     Now hazarded to thy grace.
  8517   CAESAR. For Antony,
  8518     I have no ears to his request. The Queen
  8519     Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
  8520     From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
  8521     Or take his life there. This if she perform,
  8522     She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
  8523   EUPHRONIUS. Fortune pursue thee!
  8524   CAESAR. Bring him through the bands.           Exit EUPHRONIUS
  8525     [To THYREUS] To try thy eloquence, now 'tis time. Dispatch;
  8526     From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,
  8527     And in our name, what she requires; add more,
  8528     From thine invention, offers. Women are not
  8529     In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
  8530     The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus;
  8531     Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
  8532     Will answer as a law.
  8533   THYREUS. Caesar, I go.
  8534   CAESAR. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
  8535     And what thou think'st his very action speaks
  8536     In every power that moves.
  8537   THYREUS. Caesar, I shall.                               Exeunt

  8541                Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace
  8542 
  8543         Enter CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
  8544 
  8545   CLEOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?
  8546   ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.
  8547   CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?
  8548   ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will
  8549     Lord of his reason. What though you fled
  8550     From that great face of war, whose several ranges
  8551     Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
  8552     The itch of his affection should not then
  8553     Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
  8554     When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
  8555     The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
  8556     Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
  8557     And leave his navy gazing.
  8558   CLEOPATRA. Prithee, peace.
  8559 
  8560           Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY
  8561 
  8562   ANTONY. Is that his answer?
  8563   EUPHRONIUS. Ay, my lord.
  8564   ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
  8565     Will yield us up.
  8566   EUPHRONIUS. He says so.
  8567   ANTONY. Let her know't.
  8568     To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
  8569     And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
  8570     With principalities.
  8571   CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?
  8572   ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
  8573     Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
  8574     Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,
  8575     May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
  8576     Under the service of a child as soon
  8577     As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore
  8578     To lay his gay comparisons apart,
  8579     And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
  8580     Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.
  8581                                     Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
  8582   EUPHRONIUS. [Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
  8583     Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
  8584     Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
  8585     A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
  8586     Do draw the inward quality after them,
  8587     To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
  8588     Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
  8589     Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
  8590     His judgment too.
  8591 
  8592                        Enter a SERVANT
  8593 
  8594   SERVANT. A messenger from Caesar.
  8595   CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
  8596     Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
  8597     That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.     Exit SERVANT
  8598   ENOBARBUS. [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
  8599     The loyalty well held to fools does make
  8600     Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure
  8601     To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
  8602     Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
  8603     And earns a place i' th' story.
  8604 
  8605                        Enter THYREUS
  8606 
  8607   CLEOPATRA. Caesar's will?
  8608   THYREUS. Hear it apart.
  8609   CLEOPATRA. None but friends: say boldly.
  8610   THYREUS. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
  8611   ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
  8612     Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
  8613     Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know
  8614     Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.
  8615   THYREUS. So.
  8616     Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
  8617     Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
  8618     Further than he is Caesar.
  8619   CLEOPATRA. Go on. Right royal!
  8620   THYREUS. He knows that you embrace not Antony
  8621     As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
  8622   CLEOPATRA. O!
  8623   THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
  8624     Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
  8625     Not as deserv'd.
  8626   CLEOPATRA. He is a god, and knows
  8627     What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
  8628     But conquer'd merely.
  8629   ENOBARBUS. [Aside] To be sure of that,
  8630     I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
  8631     That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
  8632     Thy dearest quit thee.                                  Exit
  8633   THYREUS. Shall I say to Caesar
  8634     What you require of him? For he partly begs
  8635     To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
  8636     That of his fortunes you should make a staff
  8637     To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
  8638     To hear from me you had left Antony,
  8639     And put yourself under his shroud,
  8640     The universal landlord.
  8641   CLEOPATRA. What's your name?
  8642   THYREUS. My name is Thyreus.
  8643   CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger,
  8644     Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
  8645     I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt
  8646     To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.
  8647     Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
  8648     The doom of Egypt.
  8649   THYREUS. 'Tis your noblest course.
  8650     Wisdom and fortune combating together,
  8651     If that the former dare but what it can,
  8652     No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
  8653     My duty on your hand.
  8654   CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar's father oft,
  8655     When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
  8656     Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
  8657     As it rain'd kisses.
  8658 
  8659                 Re-enter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS
  8660 
  8661   ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders!
  8662     What art thou, fellow?
  8663   THYREUS. One that but performs
  8664     The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
  8665     To have command obey'd.
  8666   ENOBARBUS. [Aside] You will be whipt.
  8667   ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
  8668     Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
  8669     Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth
  8670     And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
  8671     Antony yet.
  8672 
  8673                        Enter servants
  8674 
  8675     Take hence this Jack and whip him.
  8676   ENOBARBUS. 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
  8677     Than with an old one dying.
  8678   ANTONY. Moon and stars!
  8679     Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
  8680     That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
  8681     So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name
  8682     Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
  8683     Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
  8684     And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.
  8685   THYMUS. Mark Antony-
  8686   ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,
  8687     Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall
  8688     Bear us an errand to him.       Exeunt servants with THYREUS
  8689     You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!
  8690     Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
  8691     Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
  8692     And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
  8693     By one that looks on feeders?
  8694   CLEOPATRA. Good my lord-
  8695   ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.
  8696     But when we in our viciousness grow hard-
  8697     O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,
  8698     In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
  8699     Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
  8700     To our confusion.
  8701   CLEOPATRA. O, is't come to this?
  8702   ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
  8703     Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment
  8704     Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
  8705     Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
  8706     Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,
  8707     Though you can guess what temperance should be,
  8708     You know not what it is.
  8709   CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?
  8710   ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
  8711     And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
  8712     My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
  8713     And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
  8714     Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
  8715     The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
  8716     And to proclaim it civilly were like
  8717     A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
  8718     For being yare about him.
  8719 
  8720               Re-enter a SERVANT with THYREUS
  8721 
  8722     Is he whipt?
  8723   SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.
  8724   ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
  8725   SERVANT. He did ask favour.
  8726   ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
  8727     Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
  8728     To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
  8729     Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
  8730     The white hand of a lady fever thee!
  8731     Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
  8732     Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
  8733     He makes me angry with him; for he seems
  8734     Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
  8735     Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
  8736     And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
  8737     When my good stars, that were my former guides,
  8738     Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
  8739     Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
  8740     My speech and what is done, tell him he has
  8741     Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
  8742     He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
  8743     As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
  8744     Hence with thy stripes, be gone.                Exit THYREUS
  8745   CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?
  8746   ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon
  8747     Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone
  8748     The fall of Antony.
  8749   CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.
  8750   ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
  8751     With one that ties his points?
  8752   CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?
  8753   ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?
  8754   CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so,
  8755     From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
  8756     And poison it in the source, and the first stone
  8757     Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
  8758     Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
  8759     Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
  8760     Together with my brave Egyptians all,
  8761     By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
  8762     Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
  8763     Have buried them for prey.
  8764   ANTONY. I am satisfied.
  8765     Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
  8766     I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
  8767     Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
  8768     Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
  8769     Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
  8770     If from the field I shall return once more
  8771     To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
  8772     I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
  8773     There's hope in't yet.
  8774   CLEOPATRA. That's my brave lord!
  8775   ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
  8776     And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
  8777     Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
  8778     Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
  8779     And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
  8780     Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
  8781     All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
  8782     Let's mock the midnight bell.
  8783   CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday.
  8784     I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
  8785     Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
  8786   ANTONY. We will yet do well.
  8787   CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.
  8788   ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
  8789     The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
  8790     There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
  8791     I'll make death love me; for I will contend
  8792     Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
  8793   ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
  8794     Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
  8795     The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
  8796     A diminution in our captain's brain
  8797     Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,
  8798     It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
  8799     Some way to leave him.                                  Exit

  8803               CAESAR'S camp before Alexandria
  8804 
  8805       Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MAECENAS, with his army;
  8806                  CAESAR reading a letter
  8807 
  8808   CAESAR. He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
  8809     To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
  8810     He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,
  8811     Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
  8812     I have many other ways to die, meantime
  8813     Laugh at his challenge.
  8814   MAECENAS. Caesar must think
  8815     When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
  8816     Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
  8817     Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
  8818     Made good guard for itself.
  8819   CAESAR. Let our best heads
  8820     Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
  8821     We mean to fight. Within our files there are
  8822     Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late
  8823     Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
  8824     And feast the army; we have store to do't,
  8825     And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!          Exeunt

  8830 
  8831       Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS,
  8832                      ALEXAS, with others
  8833 
  8834   ANTONY. He will not fight with me, Domitius?
  8835   ENOBARBUS. No.
  8836   ANTONY. Why should he not?
  8837   ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
  8838     He is twenty men to one.
  8839   ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,
  8840     By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,
  8841     Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
  8842     Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
  8843   ENOBARBUS. I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
  8844   ANTONY. Well said; come on.
  8845     Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
  8846     Be bounteous at our meal.
  8847 
  8848                 Enter three or four servitors
  8849 
  8850     Give me thy hand,
  8851     Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;
  8852     Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,
  8853     And kings have been your fellows.
  8854   CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?
  8855   ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which
  8856       sorrow shoots
  8857     Out of the mind.
  8858   ANTONY. And thou art honest too.
  8859     I wish I could be made so many men,
  8860     And all of you clapp'd up together in
  8861     An Antony, that I might do you service
  8862     So good as you have done.
  8863   SERVANT. The gods forbid!
  8864   ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
  8865     Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
  8866     As when mine empire was your fellow too,
  8867     And suffer'd my command.
  8868   CLEOPATRA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
  8869     ENOBARBUS. [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.
  8870   ANTONY. Tend me to-night;
  8871     May be it is the period of your duty.
  8872     Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
  8873     A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
  8874     You'll serve another master. I look on you
  8875     As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
  8876     I turn you not away; but, like a master
  8877     Married to your good service, stay till death.
  8878     Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
  8879     And the gods yield you for't!
  8880   ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir,
  8881     To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
  8882     And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!
  8883     Transform us not to women.
  8884   ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!
  8885     Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
  8886     Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
  8887     You take me in too dolorous a sense;
  8888     For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
  8889     To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
  8890     I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
  8891     Where rather I'll expect victorious life
  8892     Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
  8893     And drown consideration.                              Exeunt

  8898 
  8899                  Enter a company of soldiers
  8900 
  8901   FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.
  8902   SECOND SOLDIER. It will determine one way. Fare you well.
  8903     Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
  8904   FIRST SOLDIER. Nothing. What news?
  8905   SECOND SOLDIER. Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
  8906   FIRST SOLDIER. Well, sir, good night.
  8907                                       [They meet other soldiers]
  8908   SECOND SOLDIER. Soldiers, have careful watch.
  8909   FIRST SOLDIER. And you. Good night, good night.
  8910                 [The two companies separate and place themselves
  8911                                    in every corner of the stage]
  8912   SECOND SOLDIER. Here we. And if to-morrow
  8913     Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
  8914     Our landmen will stand up.
  8915   THIRD SOLDIER. 'Tis a brave army,
  8916     And full of purpose.
  8917                       [Music of the hautboys is under the stage]
  8918   SECOND SOLDIER. Peace, what noise?
  8919   THIRD SOLDIER. List, list!
  8920   SECOND SOLDIER. Hark!
  8921   THIRD SOLDIER. Music i' th' air.
  8922   FOURTH SOLDIER. Under the earth.
  8923   THIRD SOLDIER. It signs well, does it not?
  8924   FOURTH SOLDIER. No.
  8925   THIRD SOLDIER. Peace, I say!
  8926     What should this mean?
  8927   SECOND SOLDIER. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
  8928     Now leaves him.
  8929   THIRD SOLDIER. Walk; let's see if other watchmen
  8930     Do hear what we do.
  8931   SECOND SOLDIER. How now, masters!
  8932   SOLDIERS. [Speaking together] How now!
  8933     How now! Do you hear this?
  8934   FIRST SOLDIER. Ay; is't not strange?
  8935   THIRD SOLDIER. Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?
  8936   FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
  8937     Let's see how it will give off.
  8938   SOLDIERS. Content. 'Tis strange.                        Exeunt

  8946 
  8947   ANTONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!
  8948   CLEOPATRA. Sleep a little.
  8949   ANTONY. No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
  8950 
  8951                    Enter EROS with armour
  8952 
  8953     Come, good fellow, put mine iron on.
  8954     If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
  8955     Because we brave her. Come.
  8956   CLEOPATRA. Nay, I'll help too.
  8957     What's this for?
  8958   ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
  8959     The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this.
  8960   CLEOPATRA. Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be.
  8961   ANTONY. Well, well;
  8962     We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
  8963     Go put on thy defences.
  8964   EROS. Briefly, sir.
  8965   CLEOPATRA. Is not this buckled well?
  8966   ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!
  8967     He that unbuckles this, till we do please
  8968     To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
  8969     Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire
  8970     More tight at this than thou. Dispatch. O love,
  8971     That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
  8972     The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
  8973     A workman in't.
  8974 
  8975                    Enter an armed SOLDIER
  8976 
  8977     Good-morrow to thee. Welcome.
  8978     Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.
  8979     To business that we love we rise betime,
  8980     And go to't with delight.
  8981   SOLDIER. A thousand, sir,
  8982     Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
  8983     And at the port expect you.
  8984                             [Shout. Flourish of trumpets within]

  8987 
  8988   CAPTAIN. The morn is fair. Good morrow, General.
  8989   ALL. Good morrow, General.
  8990   ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
  8991     This morning, like the spirit of a youth
  8992     That means to be of note, begins betimes.
  8993     So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
  8994     Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
  8995     This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
  8996     And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
  8997     On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
  8998     Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
  8999     Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

  9001   CHARMIAN. Please you retire to your chamber?
  9002   CLEOPATRA. Lead me.
  9003     He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
  9004     Determine this great war in single fight!

  9012                        meeting them
  9013 
  9014   SOLDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
  9015   ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
  9016     To make me fight at land!
  9017   SOLDIER. Hadst thou done so,
  9018     The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
  9019     That has this morning left thee, would have still
  9020     Followed thy heels.
  9021   ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?
  9022   SOLDIER. Who?
  9023     One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
  9024     He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
  9025     Say 'I am none of thine.'
  9026   ANTONY. What say'st thou?
  9027   SOLDIER. Sir,
  9028     He is with Caesar.
  9029   EROS. Sir, his chests and treasure
  9030     He has not with him.
  9031   ANTONY. Is he gone?
  9032   SOLDIER. Most certain.
  9033   ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
  9034     Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him-
  9035     I will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;
  9036     Say that I wish he never find more cause
  9037     To change a master. O, my fortunes have

  9045                        and ENOBARBUS
  9046 
  9047   CAESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
  9048     Our will is Antony be took alive;
  9049     Make it so known.
  9050   AGRIPPA. Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit
  9051   CAESAR. The time of universal peace is near.
  9052     Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world
  9053     Shall bear the olive freely.
  9054 
  9055                      Enter A MESSENGER
  9056 
  9057   MESSENGER. Antony
  9058     Is come into the field.
  9059   CAESAR. Go charge Agrippa
  9060     Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
  9061     That Antony may seem to spend his fury
  9062     Upon himself.                       Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
  9063   ENOBARBUS. Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
  9064     Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
  9065     Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
  9066     And leave his master Antony. For this pains
  9067     Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
  9068     That fell away have entertainment, but
  9069     No honourable trust. I have done ill,
  9070     Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
  9071     That I will joy no more.
  9072 
  9073                   Enter a SOLDIER of CAESAR'S

  9075   SOLDIER. Enobarbus, Antony
  9076     Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
  9077     His bounty overplus. The messenger
  9078     Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
  9079     Unloading of his mules.
  9080   ENOBARBUS. I give it you.
  9081   SOLDIER. Mock not, Enobarbus.
  9082     I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer
  9083     Out of the host. I must attend mine office,
  9084     Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
  9085     Continues still a Jove.                                 Exit
  9086   ENOBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth,
  9087     And feel I am so most. O Antony,
  9088     Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
  9089     My better service, when my turpitude
  9090     Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
  9091     If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
  9092     Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.
  9093     I fight against thee? No! I will go seek
  9094     Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
  9095     My latter part of life.                                 Exit

  9104   AGRIPPA. Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
  9105     Caesar himself has work, and our oppression

  9109 
  9110   SCARUS. O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
  9111     Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
  9112     With clouts about their heads.
  9113   ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
  9114   SCARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T,
  9115     But now 'tis made an H.
  9116   ANTONY. They do retire.
  9117   SCARUS. We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
  9118     Room for six scotches more.
  9119 
  9120                         Enter EROS
  9121 
  9122   EROS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
  9123     For a fair victory.
  9124   SCARUS. Let us score their backs
  9125     And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
  9126     'Tis sport to maul a runner.
  9127   ANTONY. I will reward thee
  9128     Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
  9129     For thy good valour. Come thee on.
  9130     SCARUS. I'll halt after.                              Exeunt

  9134                Under the walls of Alexandria
  9135 
  9136         Alarum. Enter ANTONY, again in a march; SCARUS
  9137                         with others
  9138 
  9139   ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
  9140     And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
  9141     Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood
  9142     That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
  9143     For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
  9144     Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been
  9145     Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
  9146     Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
  9147     Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
  9148     Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
  9149     The honour'd gashes whole.
  9150 
  9151                  Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
  9152 
  9153     [To SCARUS] Give me thy hand-
  9154     To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
  9155     Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world,
  9156     Chain mine arm'd neck. Leap thou, attire and all,
  9157     Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
  9158     Ride on the pants triumphing.
  9159   CLEOPATRA. Lord of lords!
  9160     O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
  9161     The world's great snare uncaught?
  9162   ANTONY. Mine nightingale,
  9163     We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey
  9164     Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
  9165     A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
  9166     Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
  9167     Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand-
  9168     Kiss it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day
  9169     As if a god in hate of mankind had
  9170     Destroyed in such a shape.
  9171   CLEOPATRA. I'll give thee, friend,
  9172     An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
  9173   ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
  9174     Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand.
  9175     Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
  9176     Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.
  9177     Had our great palace the capacity
  9178     To camp this host, we all would sup together,
  9179     And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
  9180     Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
  9181     With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
  9182     Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,
  9183     That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
  9184     Applauding our approach.                              Exeunt

  9189 
  9190       Enter a CENTURION and his company; ENOBARBUS follows
  9191 
  9192   CENTURION. If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
  9193     We must return to th' court of guard. The night
  9194     Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
  9195     By th' second hour i' th' morn.
  9196   FIRST WATCH. This last day was
  9197     A shrewd one to's.
  9198   ENOBARBUS. O, bear me witness, night-
  9199   SECOND WATCH. What man is this?
  9200   FIRST WATCH. Stand close and list him.
  9201   ENOBARBUS. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
  9202     When men revolted shall upon record
  9203     Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
  9204     Before thy face repent!
  9205   CENTURION. Enobarbus?
  9206   SECOND WATCH. Peace!
  9207     Hark further.
  9208   ENOBARBUS. O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
  9209     The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
  9210     That life, a very rebel to my will,
  9211     May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
  9212     Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
  9213     Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
  9214     And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
  9215     Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
  9216     Forgive me in thine own particular,
  9217     But let the world rank me in register
  9218     A master-leaver and a fugitive!
  9219     O Antony! O Antony!                                   [Dies]
  9220   FIRST WATCH. Let's speak to him.
  9221   CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
  9222     May concern Caesar.
  9223   SECOND WATCH. Let's do so. But he sleeps.
  9224   CENTURION. Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
  9225     Was never yet for sleep.
  9226   FIRST WATCH. Go we to him.
  9227   SECOND WATCH. Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
  9228   FIRST WATCH. Hear you, sir?
  9229   CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him.
  9230     [Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums
  9231     Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
  9232     To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
  9233     Is fully out.
  9234   SECOND WATCH. Come on, then;
  9235     He may recover yet.                     Exeunt with the body

  9240 
  9241             Enter ANTONY and SCARUS, with their army
  9242 
  9243   ANTONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
  9244     We please them not by land.
  9245   SCARUS. For both, my lord.
  9246   ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
  9247     We'd fight there too. But this it is, our foot
  9248     Upon the hills adjoining to the city
  9249     Shall stay with us- Order for sea is given;
  9250     They have put forth the haven-
  9251     Where their appointment we may best discover
  9252     And look on their endeavour.                          Exeunt

  9257 
  9258                 Enter CAESAR and his army
  9259 
  9260   CAESAR. But being charg'd, we will be still by land,
  9261     Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
  9262     Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
  9263     And hold our best advantage.                          Exeunt

  9267                   A hill near Alexandria
  9268 
  9269                   Enter ANTONY and SCARUS
  9270 
  9271   ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
  9272     I shall discover all. I'll bring thee word
  9273     Straight how 'tis like to go.                           Exit
  9274   SCARUS. Swallows have built
  9275     In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
  9276     Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
  9277     And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
  9278     Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
  9279     His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
  9280     Of what he has and has not.

  9283                       Re-enter ANTONY
  9284 
  9285   ANTONY. All is lost!
  9286     This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
  9287     My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
  9288     They cast their caps up and carouse together
  9289     Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
  9290     Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
  9291     Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
  9292     For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
  9293     I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.       Exit SCARUS
  9294     O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more!
  9295     Fortune and Antony part here; even here
  9296     Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
  9297     That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
  9298     Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
  9299     On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
  9300     That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
  9301     O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
  9302     Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
  9303     Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-
  9304     Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose
  9305     Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.
  9306     What, Eros, Eros!
  9307 
  9308                       Enter CLEOPATRA
  9309 
  9310     Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
  9311   CLEOPATRA. Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
  9312   ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
  9313     And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
  9314     And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
  9315     Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
  9316     Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
  9317     For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
  9318     Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
  9319     With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA
  9320     'Tis well th'art gone,
  9321     If it be well to live; but better 'twere
  9322     Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
  9323     Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
  9324     The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
  9325     Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
  9326     Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
  9327     And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
  9328     Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.
  9329     To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
  9330     Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho!              Exit

  9335 
  9336       Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
  9337 
  9338   CLEOPATRA. Help me, my women. O, he is more mad
  9339     Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
  9340     Was never so emboss'd.
  9341   CHARMIAN. To th'monument!
  9342     There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
  9343     The soul and body rive not more in parting
  9344     Than greatness going off.
  9345   CLEOPATRA. To th' monument!
  9346     Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
  9347     Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'
  9348     And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
  9349     And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
  9350                                                           Exeunt

  9355 
  9356                    Enter ANTONY and EROS
  9357 
  9358   ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
  9359   EROS. Ay, noble lord.
  9360   ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
  9361     A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
  9362     A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
  9363     A forked mountain, or blue promontory
  9364     With trees upon't that nod unto the world
  9365     And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
  9366     They are black vesper's pageants.
  9367   EROS. Ay, my lord.
  9368   ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
  9369     The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
  9370     As water is in water.
  9371   EROS. It does, my lord.
  9372   ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
  9373     Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
  9374     Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
  9375     I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
  9376     Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
  9377     Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
  9378     A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
  9379     Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
  9380     Unto an enemy's triumph.
  9381     Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
  9382     Ourselves to end ourselves.
  9383 
  9384                          Enter MARDIAN
  9385 
  9386     O, thy vile lady!
  9387     She has robb'd me of my sword.
  9388   MARDIAN. No, Antony;
  9389     My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
  9390     With thine entirely.
  9391   ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
  9392     She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.
  9393   MARDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once,
  9394     And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
  9395     Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
  9396     Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
  9397     Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
  9398     The name of Antony; it was divided
  9399     Between her heart and lips. She rend'red life,
  9400     Thy name so buried in her.
  9401   ANTONY. Dead then?
  9402   MARDIAN. Dead.
  9403   ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
  9404     And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
  9405     Does pay thy labour richly. Go.                 Exit MARDIAN
  9406     Off, pluck off!
  9407     The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
  9408     The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
  9409     Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
  9410     Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
  9411     No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
  9412     You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.        Exit EROS
  9413     I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
  9414     Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
  9415     All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
  9416     Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
  9417     Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
  9418     Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
  9419     Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
  9420     Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
  9421     And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
  9422     Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
  9423     And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
  9424 
  9425                        Re-enter EROS
  9426 
  9427   EROS. What would my lord?
  9428   ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
  9429     I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
  9430     Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
  9431     Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
  9432     With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
  9433     The courage of a woman; less noble mind
  9434     Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
  9435     'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
  9436     That, when the exigent should come- which now
  9437     Is come indeed- when I should see behind me
  9438     Th' inevitable prosecution of
  9439     Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
  9440     Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.
  9441     Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
  9442     Put colour in thy cheek.
  9443   EROS. The gods withhold me!
  9444     Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
  9445     Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
  9446   ANTONY. Eros,
  9447     Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
  9448     Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
  9449     His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
  9450     To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
  9451     Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
  9452     His baseness that ensued?
  9453   EROS. I would not see't.
  9454   ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
  9455     Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
  9456     Most useful for thy country.
  9457   EROS. O, sir, pardon me!
  9458   ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
  9459     To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
  9460     Or thy precedent services are all
  9461     But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
  9462   EROS. Turn from me then that noble countenance,
  9463     Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
  9464   ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
  9465   EROS. My sword is drawn.
  9466   ANTONY. Then let it do at once
  9467     The thing why thou hast drawn it.
  9468   EROS. My dear master,
  9469     My captain and my emperor, let me say,
  9470     Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
  9471   ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
  9472   EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
  9473   ANTONY. Now, Eros.
  9474   EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow
  9475     Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself
  9476   ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
  9477     Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
  9478     I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
  9479     Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
  9480     A nobleness in record. But I will be
  9481     A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
  9482     As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
  9483     Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
  9484                                           [Falling on his sword]
  9485     I learn'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-
  9486     The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
  9487 
  9488                   Enter DERCETAS and a guard
  9489 
  9490   FIRST GUARD. What's the noise?
  9491   ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
  9492     Of what I have begun.
  9493   SECOND GUARD. The star is fall'n.
  9494   FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period.
  9495   ALL. Alas, and woe!
  9496   ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
  9497   FIRST GUARD. Not I.
  9498   SECOND GUARD. Nor I.
  9499   THIRD GUARD. Nor any one.                         Exeunt guard
  9500   DERCETAS. Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
  9501     This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
  9502     Shall enter me with him.
  9503 
  9504                        Enter DIOMEDES
  9505 
  9506   DIOMEDES. Where's Antony?
  9507   DERCETAS. There, Diomed, there.
  9508   DIOMEDES. Lives he?
  9509     Wilt thou not answer, man?                     Exit DERCETAS
  9510   ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
  9511     Sufficing strokes for death.
  9512   DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord,
  9513     My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
  9514   ANTONY. When did she send thee?
  9515   DIOMEDES. Now, my lord.
  9516   ANTONY. Where is she?
  9517   DIOMEDES. Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
  9518     Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-
  9519     Which never shall be found- you did suspect
  9520     She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage
  9521     Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
  9522     But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
  9523     Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
  9524     I dread, too late.
  9525   ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
  9526   DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho!
  9527     Come, your lord calls!
  9528 
  9529              Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY
  9530 
  9531   ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
  9532     'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
  9533   FIRST GUARD. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
  9534     All your true followers out.
  9535   ALL. Most heavy day!
  9536   ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
  9537     To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome
  9538     Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,
  9539     Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.
  9540     I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends,
  9541     And have my thanks for all.           Exeunt, hearing ANTONY
  9542 ACT_4|SC_15
  9543                          SCENE XV.
  9544                    Alexandria. A monument
  9545 
  9546       Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN
  9547                          and IRAS
  9548 
  9549   CLEOPATRA. O Charmian, I will never go from hence!
  9550   CHARMIAN. Be comforted, dear madam.
  9551   CLEOPATRA. No, I will not.
  9552     All strange and terrible events are welcome,
  9553     But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
  9554     Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
  9555     As that which makes it.
  9556 
  9557                    Enter DIOMEDES, below
  9558 
  9559     How now! Is he dead?
  9560   DIOMEDES. His death's upon him, but not dead.
  9561     Look out o' th' other side your monument;
  9562     His guard have brought him thither.
  9563 
  9564             Enter, below, ANTONY, borne by the guard
  9565 
  9566   CLEOPATRA. O sun,
  9567     Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand
  9568     The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony,
  9569     Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
  9570     Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.
  9571   ANTONY. Peace!
  9572     Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
  9573     But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
  9574   CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony
  9575     Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
  9576   ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
  9577     I here importune death awhile, until
  9578     Of many thousand kisses the poor last
  9579     I lay upon thy lips.
  9580   CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear.
  9581     Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,
  9582     Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show
  9583     Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall
  9584     Be brooch'd with me. If knife, drugs, serpents, have
  9585     Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
  9586     Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
  9587     And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
  9588     Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony-
  9589     Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
  9590     Assist, good friends.
  9591   ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.
  9592   CLEOPATRA. Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
  9593     Our strength is all gone into heaviness;
  9594     That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
  9595     The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
  9596     And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
  9597     Wishers were ever fools. O come, come,
  9598                           [They heave ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
  9599     And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
  9600     Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
  9601     Thus would I wear them out.
  9602   ALL. A heavy sight!
  9603   ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.
  9604     Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
  9605   CLEOPATRA. No, let me speak; and let me rail so high
  9606     That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
  9607     Provok'd by my offence.
  9608   ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:
  9609     Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
  9610   CLEOPATRA. They do not go together.
  9611   ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:
  9612     None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
  9613   CLEOPATRA. My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
  9614     None about Caesar
  9615   ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end
  9616     Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
  9617     In feeding them with those my former fortunes
  9618     Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,
  9619     The noblest; and do now not basely die,
  9620     Not cowardly put off my helmet to
  9621     My countryman- a Roman by a Roman
  9622     Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going
  9623     I can no more.
  9624   CLEOPATRA. Noblest of men, woo't die?
  9625     Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
  9626     In this dull world, which in thy absence is
  9627     No better than a sty? O, see, my women,        [Antony dies]
  9628     The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!
  9629     O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
  9630     The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
  9631     Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
  9632     And there is nothing left remarkable
  9633     Beneath the visiting moon.                          [Swoons]
  9634   CHARMIAN. O, quietness, lady!
  9635   IRAS. She's dead too, our sovereign.
  9636   CHARMIAN. Lady!
  9637   IRAS. Madam!
  9638   CHARMIAN. O madam, madam, madam!
  9639   IRAS. Royal Egypt, Empress!
  9640   CHARMIAN. Peace, peace, Iras!
  9641   CLEOPATRA. No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
  9642     By such poor passion as the maid that milks
  9643     And does the meanest chares. It were for me
  9644     To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
  9645     To tell them that this world did equal theirs
  9646     Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
  9647     Patience is sottish, and impatience does
  9648     Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
  9649     To rush into the secret house of death
  9650     Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
  9651     What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
  9652     My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
  9653     Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
  9654     We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
  9655     Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
  9656     And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
  9657     This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
  9658     Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
  9659     But resolution and the briefest end.
  9660                    Exeunt; those above hearing off ANTONY'S body
  9661 
  9662 ACT_5|SC_1
  9663                        ACT V. SCENE I.
  9664                   Alexandria. CAESAR'S camp
  9665 
  9666       Enter CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MAECENAS, GALLUS,
  9667           PROCULEIUS, and others, his Council of War
  9668 
  9669   CAESAR. Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
  9670     Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
  9671     The pauses that he makes.
  9672   DOLABELLA. Caesar, I shall.                               Exit
  9673 
  9674              Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY
  9675 
  9676   CAESAR. Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
  9677     Appear thus to us?
  9678   DERCETAS. I am call'd Dercetas;
  9679     Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
  9680     Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
  9681     He was my master, and I wore my life
  9682     To spend upon his haters. If thou please
  9683     To take me to thee, as I was to him
  9684     I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
  9685     I yield thee up my life.
  9686   CAESAR. What is't thou say'st?
  9687   DERCETAS. I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
  9688   CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make
  9689     A greater crack. The round world
  9690     Should have shook lions into civil streets,
  9691     And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
  9692     Is not a single doom; in the name lay
  9693     A moiety of the world.
  9694   DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar,
  9695     Not by a public minister of justice,
  9696     Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
  9697     Which writ his honour in the acts it did
  9698     Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
  9699     Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
  9700     I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
  9701     With his most noble blood.
  9702   CAESAR. Look you sad, friends?
  9703     The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
  9704     To wash the eyes of kings.
  9705   AGRIPPA. And strange it is
  9706     That nature must compel us to lament
  9707     Our most persisted deeds.
  9708   MAECENAS. His taints and honours
  9709     Wag'd equal with him.
  9710   AGRIPPA. A rarer spirit never
  9711     Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us
  9712     Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
  9713   MAECENAS. When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
  9714     He needs must see himself.
  9715   CAESAR. O Antony,
  9716     I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance
  9717     Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
  9718     Have shown to thee such a declining day
  9719     Or look on thine; we could not stall together
  9720     In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
  9721     With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
  9722     That thou, my brother, my competitor
  9723     In top of all design, my mate in empire,
  9724     Friend and companion in the front of war,
  9725     The arm of mine own body, and the heart
  9726     Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
  9727     Unreconciliable, should divide
  9728     Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-
  9729 
  9730                     Enter an EGYPTIAN
  9731 
  9732     But I will tell you at some meeter season.
  9733     The business of this man looks out of him;
  9734     We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
  9735   EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,
  9736     Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
  9737     Of thy intents desires instruction,
  9738     That she preparedly may frame herself
  9739     To th' way she's forc'd to.
  9740   CAESAR. Bid her have good heart.
  9741     She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
  9742     How honourable and how kindly we
  9743     Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn
  9744     To be ungentle.
  9745   EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit
  9746   CAESAR. Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
  9747     We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts
  9748     The quality of her passion shall require,
  9749     Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
  9750     She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
  9751     Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
  9752     And with your speediest bring us what she says,
  9753     And how you find her.
  9754   PROCULEIUS. Caesar, I shall.                              Exit
  9755   CAESAR. Gallus, go you along.                      Exit GALLUS
  9756     Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius?
  9757   ALL. Dolabella!
  9758   CAESAR. Let him alone, for I remember now
  9759     How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.
  9760     Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
  9761     How hardly I was drawn into this war,
  9762     How calm and gentle I proceeded still
  9763     In all my writings. Go with me, and see
  9764     What I can show in this.                              Exeunt
  9765 
  9766 ACT_5|SC_2
  9767                          SCENE II.
  9768                 Alexandria. The monument
  9769 
  9770       Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
  9771 
  9772   CLEOPATRA. My desolation does begin to make
  9773     A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
  9774     Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
  9775     A minister of her will; and it is great
  9776     To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
  9777     Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
  9778     Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
  9779     The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
  9780 
  9781        Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS,
  9782                           and soldiers
  9783 
  9784   PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,
  9785     And bids thee study on what fair demands
  9786     Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
  9787   CLEOPATRA. What's thy name?
  9788   PROCULEIUS. My name is Proculeius.
  9789   CLEOPATRA. Antony
  9790     Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
  9791     I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
  9792     That have no use for trusting. If your master
  9793     Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
  9794     That majesty, to keep decorum, must
  9795     No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
  9796     To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
  9797     He gives me so much of mine own as I
  9798     Will kneel to him with thanks.
  9799   PROCULEIUS. Be of good cheer;
  9800     Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
  9801     Make your full reference freely to my lord,
  9802     Who is so full of grace that it flows over
  9803     On all that need. Let me report to him
  9804     Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
  9805     A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
  9806     Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
  9807   CLEOPATRA. Pray you tell him
  9808     I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
  9809     The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
  9810     A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
  9811     Look him i' th' face.
  9812   PROCULEIUS. This I'll report, dear lady.
  9813     Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
  9814     Of him that caus'd it.
  9815   GALLUS. You see how easily she may be surpris'd.
  9816 
  9817       Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the
  9818        monument by a ladder placed against a window,
  9819        and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard
  9820                 unbar and open the gates
  9821 
  9822     Guard her till Caesar come.                             Exit
  9823   IRAS. Royal Queen!
  9824   CHARMIAN. O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!
  9825   CLEOPATRA. Quick, quick, good hands.        [Drawing a dagger]
  9826   PROCULEIUS. Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
  9827     Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
  9828     Reliev'd, but not betray'd.
  9829   CLEOPATRA. What, of death too,
  9830     That rids our dogs of languish?
  9831   PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,
  9832     Do not abuse my master's bounty by
  9833     Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
  9834     His nobleness well acted, which your death
  9835     Will never let come forth.
  9836   CLEOPATRA. Where art thou, death?
  9837     Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
  9838     Worth many babes and beggars!
  9839   PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady!
  9840   CLEOPATRA. Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;
  9841     If idle talk will once be necessary,
  9842     I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
  9843     Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
  9844     Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
  9845     Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
  9846     Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
  9847     And show me to the shouting varletry
  9848     Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
  9849     Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud
  9850     Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
  9851     Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
  9852     My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
  9853     And hang me up in chains!
  9854   PROCULEIUS. You do extend
  9855     These thoughts of horror further than you shall
  9856     Find cause in Caesar.
  9857 
  9858                       Enter DOLABELLA
  9859 
  9860   DOLABELLA. Proculeius,
  9861     What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
  9862     And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
  9863     I'll take her to my guard.
  9864   PROCULEIUS. So, Dolabella,
  9865     It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
  9866     [To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
  9867     If you'll employ me to him.
  9868   CLEOPATRA. Say I would die.
  9869                                   Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldiers
  9870   DOLABELLA. Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
  9871   CLEOPATRA. I cannot tell.
  9872   DOLABELLA. Assuredly you know me.
  9873   CLEOPATRA. No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
  9874     You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
  9875     Is't not your trick?
  9876   DOLABELLA. I understand not, madam.
  9877   CLEOPATRA. I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-
  9878     O, such another sleep, that I might see
  9879     But such another man!
  9880   DOLABELLA. If it might please ye-
  9881   CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck
  9882     A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
  9883     The little O, the earth.
  9884   DOLABELLA. Most sovereign creature-
  9885   CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
  9886     Crested the world. His voice was propertied
  9887     As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
  9888     But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
  9889     He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
  9890     There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
  9891     That grew the more by reaping. His delights
  9892     Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above
  9893     The element they liv'd in. In his livery
  9894     Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
  9895     As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
  9896   DOLABELLA. Cleopatra-
  9897   CLEOPATRA. Think you there was or might be such a man
  9898     As this I dreamt of?
  9899   DOLABELLA. Gentle madam, no.
  9900   CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
  9901     But if there be nor ever were one such,
  9902     It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff
  9903     To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
  9904     An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
  9905     Condemning shadows quite.
  9906   DOLABELLA. Hear me, good madam.
  9907     Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
  9908     As answering to the weight. Would I might never
  9909     O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
  9910     By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
  9911     My very heart at root.
  9912   CLEOPATRA. I thank you, sir.
  9913     Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
  9914   DOLABELLA. I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
  9915   CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you, sir.
  9916   DOLABELLA. Though he be honourable-
  9917   CLEOPATRA. He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
  9918   DOLABELLA. Madam, he will. I know't.                [Flourish]
  9919                               [Within: 'Make way there-Caesar!']
  9920 
  9921        Enter CAESAR; GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MAECENAS, SELEUCUS,
  9922                      and others of his train
  9923 
  9924   CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt?
  9925   DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]
  9926   CAESAR. Arise, you shall not kneel.
  9927     I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
  9928   CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods
  9929     Will have it thus; my master and my lord
  9930     I must obey.
  9931   CAESAR. Take to you no hard thoughts.
  9932     The record of what injuries you did us,
  9933     Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
  9934     As things but done by chance.
  9935   CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world,
  9936     I cannot project mine own cause so well
  9937     To make it clear, but do confess I have
  9938     Been laden with like frailties which before
  9939     Have often sham'd our sex.
  9940   CAESAR. Cleopatra, know
  9941     We will extenuate rather than enforce.
  9942     If you apply yourself to our intents-
  9943     Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
  9944     A benefit in this change; but if you seek
  9945     To lay on me a cruelty by taking
  9946     Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
  9947     Of my good purposes, and put your children
  9948     To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
  9949     If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
  9950   CLEOPATRA. And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,
  9951     Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
  9952     Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
  9953   CAESAR. You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
  9954   CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
  9955     I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,
  9956     Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
  9957   SELEUCUS. Here, madam.
  9958   CLEOPATRA. This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,
  9959     Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd
  9960     To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
  9961   SELEUCUS. Madam,
  9962     I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
  9963     Speak that which is not.
  9964   CLEOPATRA. What have I kept back?
  9965   SELEUCUS. Enough to purchase what you have made known.
  9966   CAESAR. Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
  9967     Your wisdom in the deed.
  9968   CLEOPATRA. See, Caesar! O, behold,
  9969     How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;
  9970     And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
  9971     The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
  9972     Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust
  9973     Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
  9974     Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes
  9975     Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
  9976     O rarely base!
  9977   CAESAR. Good Queen, let us entreat you.
  9978   CLEOPATRA. O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
  9979     That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
  9980     Doing the honour of thy lordliness
  9981     To one so meek, that mine own servant should
  9982     Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
  9983     Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
  9984     That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
  9985     Immoment toys, things of such dignity
  9986     As we greet modern friends withal; and say
  9987     Some nobler token I have kept apart
  9988     For Livia and Octavia, to induce
  9989     Their mediation- must I be unfolded
  9990     With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
  9991     Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence;
  9992     Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
  9993     Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
  9994     Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
  9995   CAESAR. Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS
  9996   CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
  9997     For things that others do; and when we fall
  9998     We answer others' merits in our name,
  9999     Are therefore to be pitied.
 10000   CAESAR. Cleopatra,
 10001     Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
 10002     Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours,
 10003     Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
 10004     Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
 10005     Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
 10006     Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;
 10007     For we intend so to dispose you as
 10008     Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
 10009     Our care and pity is so much upon you
 10010     That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
 10011   CLEOPATRA. My master and my lord!
 10012   CAESAR. Not so. Adieu.
 10013                            Flourish. Exeunt CAESAR and his train
 10014   CLEOPATRA. He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
 10015     Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!
 10016                                              [Whispers CHARMIAN]
 10017   IRAS. Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
 10018     And we are for the dark.
 10019   CLEOPATRA. Hie thee again.
 10020     I have spoke already, and it is provided;
 10021     Go put it to the haste.
 10022   CHARMIAN. Madam, I will.
 10023 
 10024                       Re-enter DOLABELLA
 10025 
 10026   DOLABELLA. Where's the Queen?
 10027   CHARMIAN. Behold, sir.                                    Exit
 10028   CLEOPATRA. Dolabella!
 10029   DOLABELLA. Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
 10030     Which my love makes religion to obey,
 10031     I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
 10032     Intends his journey, and within three days
 10033     You with your children will he send before.
 10034     Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
 10035     Your pleasure and my promise.
 10036   CLEOPATRA. Dolabella,
 10037     I shall remain your debtor.
 10038   DOLABELLA. I your servant.
 10039     Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.
 10040   CLEOPATRA. Farewell, and thanks.                Exit DOLABELLA
 10041     Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
 10042     Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
 10043     In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves,
 10044     With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
 10045     Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
 10046     Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
 10047     And forc'd to drink their vapour.
 10048   IRAS. The gods forbid!
 10049   CLEOPATRA. Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
 10050     Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
 10051     Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
 10052     Extemporally will stage us, and present
 10053     Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
 10054     Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
 10055     Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
 10056     I' th' posture of a whore.
 10057   IRAS. O the good gods!
 10058   CLEOPATRA. Nay, that's certain.
 10059   IRAS. I'll never see't, for I am sure mine nails
 10060     Are stronger than mine eyes.
 10061   CLEOPATRA. Why, that's the way
 10062     To fool their preparation and to conquer
 10063     Their most absurd intents.
 10064 
 10065                       Enter CHARMIAN
 10066 
 10067     Now, Charmian!
 10068     Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch
 10069     My best attires. I am again for Cydnus,
 10070     To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.
 10071     Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
 10072     And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
 10073     To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
 10074                                        Exit IRAS. A noise within
 10075     Wherefore's this noise?
 10076 
 10077                      Enter a GUARDSMAN
 10078 
 10079   GUARDSMAN. Here is a rural fellow
 10080     That will not be denied your Highness' presence.
 10081     He brings you figs.
 10082   CLEOPATRA. Let him come in.                     Exit GUARDSMAN
 10083     What poor an instrument
 10084     May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
 10085     My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing
 10086     Of woman in me. Now from head to foot
 10087     I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
 10088     No planet is of mine.
 10089 
 10090           Re-enter GUARDSMAN and CLOWN, with a basket
 10091 
 10092   GUARDSMAN. This is the man.
 10093   CLEOPATRA. Avoid, and leave him.                Exit GUARDSMAN
 10094     Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
 10095     That kills and pains not?
 10096   CLOWN. Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should
 10097     desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
 10098     do die of it do seldom or never recover.
 10099   CLEOPATRA. Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
 10100   CLOWN. Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no
 10101     longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given
 10102     to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how
 10103     she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes
 10104     a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that
 10105     they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is
 10106     most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
 10107   CLEOPATRA. Get thee hence; farewell.
 10108   CLOWN. I wish you all joy of the worm.
 10109                                           [Sets down the basket]
 10110   CLEOPATRA. Farewell.
 10111   CLOWN. You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his
 10112     kind.
 10113   CLEOPATRA. Ay, ay; farewell.
 10114   CLOWN. Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
 10115     of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
 10116   CLEOPATRA. Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
 10117   CLOWN. Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
 10118     the feeding.
 10119   CLEOPATRA. Will it eat me?
 10120   CLOWN. You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
 10121     himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for
 10122     the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same
 10123     whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
 10124     every ten that they make the devils mar five.
 10125   CLEOPATRA. Well, get thee gone; farewell.
 10126   CLOWN. Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th' worm.         Exit
 10127 
 10128              Re-enter IRAS, with a robe, crown, &c.
 10129 
 10130   CLEOPATRA. Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
 10131     Immortal longings in me. Now no more
 10132     The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
 10133     Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
 10134     Antony call. I see him rouse himself
 10135     To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
 10136     The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
 10137     To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come.
 10138     Now to that name my courage prove my title!
 10139     I am fire and air; my other elements
 10140     I give to baser life. So, have you done?
 10141     Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
 10142     Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.
 10143                               [Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
 10144     Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
 10145     If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
 10146     The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
 10147     Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
 10148     If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
 10149     It is not worth leave-taking.
 10150   CHARMIAN. Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
 10151     The gods themselves do weep.
 10152   CLEOPATRA. This proves me base.
 10153     If she first meet the curled Antony,
 10154     He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
 10155     Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
 10156                     [To an asp, which she applies to her breast]
 10157     With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
 10158     Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
 10159     Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,
 10160     That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
 10161     Unpolicied!
 10162   CHARMIAN. O Eastern star!
 10163   CLEOPATRA. Peace, peace!
 10164     Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
 10165     That sucks the nurse asleep?
 10166   CHARMIAN. O, break! O, break!
 10167   CLEOPATRA. As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-
 10168     O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:
 10169                                [Applying another asp to her arm]
 10170     What should I stay-                                   [Dies]
 10171   CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
 10172     Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
 10173     A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
 10174     And golden Phoebus never be beheld
 10175     Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
 10176     I'll mend it and then play-
 10177 
 10178                   Enter the guard, rushing in
 10179 
 10180   FIRST GUARD. Where's the Queen?
 10181   CHARMIAN. Speak softly, wake her not.
 10182   FIRST GUARD. Caesar hath sent-
 10183   CHARMIAN. Too slow a messenger.               [Applies an asp]
 10184     O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.
 10185   FIRST GUARD. Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.
 10186   SECOND GUARD. There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
 10187   FIRST GUARD. What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
 10188   CHARMIAN. It is well done, and fitting for a princes
 10189     Descended of so many royal kings.
 10190     Ah, soldier!                                 [CHARMIAN dies]
 10191 
 10192                       Re-enter DOLABELLA
 10193 
 10194   DOLABELLA. How goes it here?
 10195   SECOND GUARD. All dead.
 10196   DOLABELLA. Caesar, thy thoughts
 10197     Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
 10198     To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
 10199     So sought'st to hinder.
 10200                       [Within: 'A way there, a way for Caesar!']
 10201 
 10202               Re-enter CAESAR and all his train
 10203 
 10204   DOLABELLA. O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
 10205     That you did fear is done.
 10206   CAESAR. Bravest at the last,
 10207     She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
 10208     Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
 10209     I do not see them bleed.
 10210   DOLABELLA. Who was last with them?
 10211   FIRST GUARD. A simple countryman that brought her figs.
 10212     This was his basket.
 10213   CAESAR. Poison'd then.
 10214   FIRST GUARD. O Caesar,
 10215     This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood and spake.
 10216     I found her trimming up the diadem
 10217     On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,
 10218     And on the sudden dropp'd.
 10219   CAESAR. O noble weakness!
 10220     If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
 10221     By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
 10222     As she would catch another Antony
 10223     In her strong toil of grace.
 10224   DOLABELLA. Here on her breast
 10225     There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
 10226     The like is on her arm.
 10227   FIRST GUARD. This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
 10228     Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves
 10229     Upon the caves of Nile.
 10230   CAESAR. Most probable
 10231     That so she died; for her physician tells me
 10232     She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
 10233     Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
 10234     And bear her women from the monument.
 10235     She shall be buried by her Antony;
 10236     No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
 10237     A pair so famous. High events as these
 10238     Strike those that make them; and their story is
 10239     No less in pity than his glory which
 10240     Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
 10241     In solemn show attend this funeral,
 10242     And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
 10243     High order in this great solemnity.                   Exeunt
 10244 
 10245

 10312 SCENE:
 10313 OLIVER'S house; FREDERICK'S court; and the Forest of Arden
 10314 
 10315 ACT I. SCENE I.
 10316 Orchard of OLIVER'S house
 10317 
 10318 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
 10319 
 10320   ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
 10321     me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
 10322     charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
 10323     begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
 10324     report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
 10325     rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
 10326     home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
 10327     birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
 10328     bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
 10329     they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
 10330     hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
 10331     the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
 10332     as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
 10333     something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
 10334     me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
 10335     brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
 10336     education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
 10337     my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
 10338     this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
 10339     wise remedy how to avoid it.
 10340 
 10341                            Enter OLIVER
 10342 
 10343   ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
 10344   ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
 10345     up.                                           [ADAM retires]
 10346   OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?
 10347   ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
 10348   OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?
 10349   ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
 10350     poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
 10351   OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
 10352   ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
 10353     prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
 10354   OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?
 10355   ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
 10356   OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?
 10357   ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
 10358     my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
 10359     should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better
 10360     in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
 10361     away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as
 10362     much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
 10363     before me is nearer to his reverence.
 10364   OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
 10365   ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
 10366   OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
 10367   ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
 10368     Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
 10369     a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not
 10370     take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
 10371     tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
 10372   ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
 10373     remembrance, be at accord.
 10374   OLIVER. Let me go, I say.
 10375   ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father
 10376     charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
 10377     train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
 10378     gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
 10379     me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
 10380     exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
 10381     allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy
 10382     my fortunes.
 10383   OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
 10384     get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
 10385     some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
 10386   ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
 10387   OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.
 10388   ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
 10389     your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke
 10390     such a word.
 10391                                          Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
 10392   OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
 10393     your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla,
 10394     Dennis!
 10395 
 10396                           Enter DENNIS
 10397 
 10398   DENNIS. Calls your worship?
 10399   OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
 10400   DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
 10401     to you.
 10402   OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
 10403     to-morrow the wrestling is.
 10404 
 10405                           Enter CHARLES
 10406 
 10407   CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.
 10408   OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
 10409     court?
 10410   CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
 10411     is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;
 10412     and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
 10413     exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
 10414     therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
 10415   OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
 10416     with her father?
 10417   CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
 10418     being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
 10419     followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at
 10420     the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
 10421     daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
 10422   OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?
 10423   CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many
 10424     merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood
 10425     of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
 10426     and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
 10427   OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
 10428   CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
 10429     matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
 10430     brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
 10431     me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
 10432     that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
 10433     Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
 10434     be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
 10435     in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
 10436     you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
 10437     or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
 10438     thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
 10439   OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
 10440     find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my
 10441     brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
 10442     dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
 10443     Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of
 10444     ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
 10445     and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
 10446     Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
 10447     neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
 10448     dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
 10449     himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
 10450     thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
 10451     hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
 10452     assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one
 10453     so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly
 10454     of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush
 10455     and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
 10456   CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
 10457     to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,
 10458     I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!
 10459  Exit
 10460   OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I
 10461     hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
 10462     hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and
 10463     yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
 10464     beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
 10465     especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
 10466     altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
 10467     shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
 10468     thither, which now I'll go about.                       Exit

 10484 SCENE II.
 10485 A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
 10486 
 10487 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
 10488 
 10489   CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
 10490   ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
 10491     would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
 10492     a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
 10493     extraordinary pleasure.
 10494   CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
 10495     love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
 10496     uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I
 10497     could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
 10498     thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
 10499     as mine is to thee.
 10500   ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
 10501     rejoice in yours.
 10502   CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
 10503     have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
 10504     he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
 10505     again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
 10506     oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
 10507     Rose, be merry.
 10508   ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
 10509     Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
 10510   CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
 10511     in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
 10512     of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
 10513   ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
 10514   CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
 10515     wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
 10516   ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
 10517     misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
 10518     gifts to women.
 10519   CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
 10520     honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
 10521     ill-favouredly.
 10522   ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
 10523     Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
 10524     Nature.
 10525 
 10526                          Enter TOUCHSTONE
 10527 
 10528   CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
 10529     Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
 10530     flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
 10531     the argument?
 10532   ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
 10533     Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
 10534   CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
 10535     Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
 10536     such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
 10537     always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How
 10538     now, wit! Whither wander you?
 10539   TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.
 10540   CELIA. Were you made the messenger?
 10541   TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
 10542   ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?
 10543   TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
 10544     good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
 10545     Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
 10546     was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
 10547   CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
 10548   ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
 10549   TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
 10550     by your beards that I am a knave.
 10551   CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
 10552   TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
 10553     swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
 10554     knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
 10555     had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
 10556     that mustard.
 10557   CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
 10558   TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
 10559   CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
 10560     more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
 10561   TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
 10562     men do foolishly.
 10563   CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
 10564     fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
 10565     makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
 10566 
 10567                            Enter LE BEAU
 10568 
 10569   ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.
 10570   CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
 10571   ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
 10572   CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
 10573     Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
 10574   LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
 10575   CELIA. Sport! of what colour?
 10576   LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
 10577   ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.
 10578   TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
 10579   CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
 10580   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
 10581   ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
 10582   LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
 10583     wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
 10584   ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
 10585   LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
 10586     ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
 10587     here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
 10588   CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
 10589   LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-
 10590   CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.
 10591   LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
 10592   ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
 10593     these presents'-
 10594   LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
 10595     wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
 10596     his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd
 10597     the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
 10598     their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
 10599     beholders take his part with weeping.
 10600   ROSALIND. Alas!
 10601   TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
 10602     lost?
 10603   LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.
 10604   TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
 10605     that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
 10606   CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.
 10607   ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
 10608     his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we
 10609     see this wrestling, cousin?
 10610   LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
 10611     appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
 10612   CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
 10613 
 10614            Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,
 10615                      CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS
 10616 
 10617   FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
 10618     peril on his forwardness.
 10619   ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?
 10620   LE BEAU. Even he, madam.
 10621   CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
 10622   FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
 10623     see the wrestling?
 10624   ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
 10625   FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
 10626     there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth
 10627     I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to
 10628     him, ladies; see if you can move him.
 10629   CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
 10630   FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.
 10631                                      [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
 10632   LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
 10633   ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.
 10634   ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
 10635   ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
 10636     but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
 10637   CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
 10638     You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
 10639     yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
 10640     fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
 10641     enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own
 10642     safety and give over this attempt.
 10643   ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
 10644     misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
 10645     wrestling might not go forward.
 10646   ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
 10647     wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
 10648     ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
 10649     with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
 10650     sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
 10651     willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none
 10652     to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only
 10653     in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when
 10654     I have made it empty.
 10655   ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with
 10656     you.
 10657   CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.
 10658   ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
 10659   CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!
 10660   CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
 10661     lie with his mother earth?
 10662   ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
 10663   FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.
 10664   CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
 10665     second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
 10666   ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
 10667     before; but come your ways.
 10668   ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
 10669   CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
 10670     leg.                                          [They wrestle]
 10671   ROSALIND. O excellent young man!
 10672   CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should
 10673     down.
 10674                                       [CHARLES is thrown. Shout]
 10675   FREDERICK. No more, no more.
 10676   ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
 10677   FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?
 10678   LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.
 10679   FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
 10680   ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
 10681     Boys.
 10682   FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
 10683     The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
 10684     But I did find him still mine enemy.
 10685     Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,
 10686     Hadst thou descended from another house.
 10687     But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;
 10688     I would thou hadst told me of another father.
 10689                                  Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU
 10690   CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
 10691   ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
 10692     His youngest son- and would not change that calling
 10693     To be adopted heir to Frederick.
 10694   ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
 10695     And all the world was of my father's mind;
 10696     Had I before known this young man his son,
 10697     I should have given him tears unto entreaties
 10698     Ere he should thus have ventur'd.
 10699   CELIA. Gentle cousin,
 10700     Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
 10701     My father's rough and envious disposition
 10702     Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;
 10703     If you do keep your promises in love
 10704     But justly as you have exceeded all promise,
 10705     Your mistress shall be happy.
 10706   ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
 10707     Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
 10708     That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
 10709     Shall we go, coz?
 10710   CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
 10711   ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
 10712     Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up
 10713     Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
 10714   ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
 10715     I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
 10716     Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
 10717     More than your enemies.
 10718   CELIA. Will you go, coz?
 10719   ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.
 10720                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
 10721   ORLANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
 10722     I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
 10723     O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
 10724     Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
 10725 
 10726                       Re-enter LE BEAU
 10727 
 10728   LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
 10729     To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd
 10730     High commendation, true applause, and love,
 10731     Yet such is now the Duke's condition
 10732     That he misconstrues all that you have done.
 10733     The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,
 10734     More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
 10735   ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
 10736     Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
 10737     That here was at the wrestling?
 10738   LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
 10739     But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;
 10740     The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
 10741     And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
 10742     To keep his daughter company; whose loves
 10743     Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
 10744     But I can tell you that of late this Duke
 10745     Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
 10746     Grounded upon no other argument
 10747     But that the people praise her for her virtues
 10748     And pity her for her good father's sake;
 10749     And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
 10750     Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
 10751     Hereafter, in a better world than this,
 10752     I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
 10753   ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
 10754                                                     Exit LE BEAU
 10755     Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
 10756     From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
 10757     But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit
 10758 
 10759 
 10760 
 10761 
 10762 SCENE III.
 10763 The DUKE's palace
 10764 
 10765 Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
 10766 
 10767   CELIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
 10768     Not a word?
 10769   ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.
 10770   CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
 10771     throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
 10772   ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
 10773     be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
 10774   CELIA. But is all this for your father?
 10775   ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
 10776     briers is this working-day world!
 10777   CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
 10778     foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
 10779     will catch them.
 10780   ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
 10781     heart.
 10782   CELIA. Hem them away.
 10783   ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
 10784   CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
 10785   ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
 10786   CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
 10787     a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in
 10788     good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
 10789     into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
 10790   ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
 10791   CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
 10792     By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
 10793     father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
 10794   ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
 10795   CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
 10796 
 10797                     Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
 10798 
 10799   ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
 10800     do. Look, here comes the Duke.
 10801   CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.
 10802   FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
 10803     And get you from our court.
 10804   ROSALIND. Me, uncle?
 10805   FREDERICK. You, cousin.
 10806     Within these ten days if that thou beest found
 10807     So near our public court as twenty miles,
 10808     Thou diest for it.
 10809   ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
 10810     Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
 10811     If with myself I hold intelligence,
 10812     Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
 10813     If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
 10814     As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,
 10815     Never so much as in a thought unborn
 10816     Did I offend your Highness.
 10817   FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
 10818     If their purgation did consist in words,
 10819     They are as innocent as grace itself.
 10820     Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
 10821   ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
 10822     Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
 10823   FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
 10824   ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
 10825     So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
 10826     Treason is not inherited, my lord;
 10827     Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
 10828     What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
 10829     Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
 10830     To think my poverty is treacherous.
 10831   CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
 10832   FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
 10833     Else had she with her father rang'd along.
 10834   CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
 10835     It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
 10836     I was too young that time to value her,
 10837     But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
 10838     Why so am I: we still have slept together,
 10839     Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
 10840     And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
 10841     Still we went coupled and inseparable.
 10842   FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
 10843     Her very silence and her patience,
 10844     Speak to the people, and they pity her.
 10845     Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;
 10846     And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
 10847     When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
 10848     Firm and irrevocable is my doom
 10849     Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
 10850   CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
 10851     I cannot live out of her company.
 10852   FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
 10853     If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
 10854     And in the greatness of my word, you die.
 10855                                            Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
 10856   CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
 10857     Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
 10858     I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
 10859   ROSALIND. I have more cause.
 10860   CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
 10861     Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke
 10862     Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
 10863   ROSALIND. That he hath not.
 10864   CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
 10865     Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
 10866     Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
 10867     No; let my father seek another heir.
 10868     Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
 10869     Whither to go, and what to bear with us;
 10870     And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
 10871     To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
 10872     For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
 10873     Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
 10874   ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
 10875   CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
 10876   ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
 10877     Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
 10878     Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
 10879   CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
 10880     And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
 10881     The like do you; so shall we pass along,
 10882     And never stir assailants.
 10883   ROSALIND. Were it not better,
 10884     Because that I am more than common tall,
 10885     That I did suit me all points like a man?
 10886     A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
 10887     A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
 10888     Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
 10889     We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
 10890     As many other mannish cowards have
 10891     That do outface it with their semblances.
 10892   CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
 10893   ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
 10894     And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
 10895     But what will you be call'd?
 10896   CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:
 10897     No longer Celia, but Aliena.
 10898   ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
 10899     The clownish fool out of your father's court?
 10900     Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
 10901   CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
 10902     Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
 10903     And get our jewels and our wealth together;
 10904     Devise the fittest time and safest way
 10905     To hide us from pursuit that will be made
 10906     After my flight. Now go we in content
 10907     To liberty, and not to banishment.                    Exeunt

 10923 ACT II. SCENE I.
 10924 The Forest of Arden
 10925 
 10926 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS, like foresters
 10927 
 10928   DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
 10929     Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
 10930     Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
 10931     More free from peril than the envious court?
 10932     Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
 10933     The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
 10934     And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
 10935     Which when it bites and blows upon my body,
 10936     Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
 10937     'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
 10938     That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
 10939     Sweet are the uses of adversity,
 10940     Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
 10941     Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
 10942     And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
 10943     Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
 10944     Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
 10945     I would not change it.
 10946   AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,
 10947     That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
 10948     Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
 10949   DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
 10950     And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
 10951     Being native burghers of this desert city,
 10952     Should, in their own confines, with forked heads
 10953     Have their round haunches gor'd.
 10954   FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,
 10955     The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
 10956     And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
 10957     Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
 10958     To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
 10959     Did steal behind him as he lay along
 10960     Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
 10961     Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
 10962     To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,
 10963     That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
 10964     Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
 10965     The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
 10966     That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
 10967     Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
 10968     Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
 10969     In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
 10970     Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
 10971     Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
 10972     Augmenting it with tears.
 10973   DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?
 10974     Did he not moralize this spectacle?
 10975   FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.
 10976     First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
 10977     'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
 10978     As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
 10979     To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,
 10980     Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
 10981     ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
 10982     The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,
 10983     Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
 10984     And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
 10985     'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
 10986     'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
 10987     Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
 10988     Thus most invectively he pierceth through
 10989     The body of the country, city, court,
 10990     Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
 10991     Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
 10992     To fright the animals, and to kill them up
 10993     In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
 10994   DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?
 10995   SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
 10996     Upon the sobbing deer.
 10997   DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;
 10998     I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
 10999     For then he's full of matter.
 11000   FIRST LORD. I'll bring you to him straight.             Exeunt
 11001 
 11002 
 11003 
 11004 
 11005 SCENE II.
 11006 The DUKE'S palace
 11007 
 11008 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
 11009 
 11010   FREDERICK. Can it be possible that no man saw them?
 11011     It cannot be; some villains of my court
 11012     Are of consent and sufferance in this.
 11013   FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her.
 11014     The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
 11015     Saw her abed, and in the morning early
 11016     They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.
 11017   SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
 11018     Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
 11019     Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
 11020     Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
 11021     Your daughter and her cousin much commend
 11022     The parts and graces of the wrestler
 11023     That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
 11024     And she believes, wherever they are gone,
 11025     That youth is surely in their company.
 11026   FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
 11027     If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
 11028     I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly;
 11029     And let not search and inquisition quail
 11030     To bring again these foolish runaways.                Exeunt
 11031 
 11032 
 11033 
 11034 
 11035 SCENE III.
 11036 Before OLIVER'S house
 11037 
 11038 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
 11039 
 11040   ORLANDO. Who's there?
 11041   ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
 11042     O my sweet master! O you memory
 11043     Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
 11044     Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
 11045     And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
 11046     Why would you be so fond to overcome
 11047     The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
 11048     Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
 11049     Know you not, master, to some kind of men
 11050     Their graces serve them but as enemies?
 11051     No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
 11052     Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
 11053     O, what a world is this, when what is comely
 11054     Envenoms him that bears it!
 11055   ORLANDO. Why, what's the matter?
 11056   ADAM. O unhappy youth!
 11057     Come not within these doors; within this roof
 11058     The enemy of all your graces lives.
 11059     Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
 11060     Yet not the son; I will not call him son
 11061     Of him I was about to call his father-
 11062     Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
 11063     To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
 11064     And you within it. If he fail of that,
 11065     He will have other means to cut you off;
 11066     I overheard him and his practices.
 11067     This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
 11068     Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
 11069   ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
 11070   ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
 11071   ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
 11072     Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
 11073     A thievish living on the common road?
 11074     This I must do, or know not what to do;
 11075     Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
 11076     I rather will subject me to the malice
 11077     Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
 11078   ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
 11079     The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
 11080     Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
 11081     When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
 11082     And unregarded age in corners thrown.
 11083     Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
 11084     Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
 11085     Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
 11086     All this I give you. Let me be your servant;
 11087     Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
 11088     For in my youth I never did apply
 11089     Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
 11090     Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
 11091     The means of weakness and debility;
 11092     Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
 11093     Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
 11094     I'll do the service of a younger man
 11095     In all your business and necessities.
 11096   ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears
 11097     The constant service of the antique world,
 11098     When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
 11099     Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
 11100     Where none will sweat but for promotion,
 11101     And having that do choke their service up
 11102     Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
 11103     But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
 11104     That cannot so much as a blossom yield
 11105     In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
 11106     But come thy ways, we'll go along together,
 11107     And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
 11108     We'll light upon some settled low content.
 11109   ADAM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
 11110     To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
 11111     From seventeen years till now almost four-score
 11112     Here lived I, but now live here no more.
 11113     At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
 11114     But at fourscore it is too late a week;
 11115     Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
 11116     Than to die well and not my master's debtor.          Exeunt
 11117 
 11118 
 11119 
 11120 
 11121 SCENE IV.
 11122 The Forest of Arden
 11123 
 11124 Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE
 11125 
 11126   ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
 11127   TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
 11128   ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
 11129     and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as
 11130     doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat;
 11131     therefore, courage, good Aliena.
 11132   CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
 11133   TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
 11134     yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you
 11135     have no money in your purse.
 11136   ROSALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
 11137   TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
 11138     home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.
 11139 
 11140                         Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
 11141 
 11142   ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
 11143     young man and an old in solemn talk.
 11144   CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.
 11145   SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
 11146   CORIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
 11147   SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
 11148     Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
 11149     As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
 11150     But if thy love were ever like to mine,
 11151     As sure I think did never man love so,
 11152     How many actions most ridiculous
 11153     Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
 11154   CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
 11155   SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
 11156     If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
 11157     That ever love did make thee run into,
 11158     Thou hast not lov'd;
 11159     Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
 11160     Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
 11161     Thou hast not lov'd;
 11162     Or if thou hast not broke from company
 11163     Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
 11164     Thou hast not lov'd.
 11165     O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
 11166   ROSALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
 11167     I have by hard adventure found mine own.
 11168   TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
 11169     sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
 11170     Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the
 11171     cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember
 11172     the wooing of  peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
 11173     and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these
 11174     for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers;
 11175     but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal
 11176     in folly.
 11177   ROSALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
 11178   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
 11179     my shins against it.
 11180   ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
 11181     Is much upon my fashion.
 11182   TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
 11183   CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man
 11184     If he for gold will give us any food;
 11185     I faint almost to death.
 11186   TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!
 11187   ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
 11188   CORIN. Who calls?
 11189   TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.
 11190   CORIN. Else are they very wretched.
 11191   ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
 11192   CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
 11193   ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
 11194     Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
 11195     Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
 11196     Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
 11197     And faints for succour.
 11198   CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her,
 11199     And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
 11200     My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
 11201     But I am shepherd to another man,
 11202     And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
 11203     My master is of churlish disposition,
 11204     And little recks to find the way to heaven
 11205     By doing deeds of hospitality.
 11206     Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
 11207     Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
 11208     By reason of his absence, there is nothing
 11209     That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
 11210     And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
 11211   ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
 11212   CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
 11213     That little cares for buying any thing.
 11214   ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
 11215     Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
 11216     And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
 11217   CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
 11218     And willingly could waste my time in it.
 11219   CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
 11220     Go with me; if you like upon report
 11221     The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
 11222     I will your very faithful feeder be,
 11223     And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt
 11224 
 11225 
 11226 
 11227 
 11228 SCENE V.
 11229 Another part of the forest
 11230 
 11231 Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and OTHERS
 11232 
 11233                        SONG
 11234   AMIENS.    Under the greenwood tree
 11235                Who loves to lie with me,
 11236                And turn his merry note
 11237                Unto the sweet bird's throat,
 11238              Come hither, come hither, come hither.
 11239                Here shall he see
 11240                No enemy
 11241              But winter and rough weather.
 11242 
 11243   JAQUES. More, more, I prithee, more.
 11244   AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
 11245   JAQUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
 11246     out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
 11247   AMIENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
 11248   JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
 11249     Come, more; another stanzo. Call you 'em stanzos?
 11250   AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
 11251   JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will
 11252     you sing?
 11253   AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.
 11254   JAQUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
 11255     that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes;
 11256     and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a
 11257     penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you
 11258     that will not, hold your tongues.
 11259   AMIENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
 11260     will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
 11261     you.
 11262   JAQUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
 11263     disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he; but
 11264     I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble,
 11265     come.
 11266 
 11267                        SONG
 11268               [All together here]
 11269 
 11270            Who doth ambition shun,
 11271            And loves to live i' th' sun,
 11272            Seeking the food he eats,
 11273            And pleas'd with what he gets,
 11274          Come hither, come hither, come hither.
 11275            Here shall he see
 11276            No enemy
 11277            But winter and rough weather.
 11278 
 11279   JAQUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
 11280     despite of my invention.
 11281   AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
 11282   JAQUES. Thus it goes:
 11283 
 11284              If it do come to pass
 11285              That any man turn ass,
 11286              Leaving his wealth and ease
 11287              A stubborn will to please,
 11288            Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
 11289              Here shall he see
 11290              Gross fools as he,
 11291              An if he will come to me.
 11292 
 11293   AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
 11294   JAQUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll
 11295     go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the
 11296     first-born of Egypt.
 11297   AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
 11298                                                 Exeunt severally

 11303 SCENE VI.
 11304 The forest
 11305 
 11306 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
 11307 
 11308   ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
 11309     I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
 11310   ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
 11311     little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
 11312     forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
 11313     bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
 11314     powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
 11315     arm's end. I will here be with the presently; and if I bring thee
 11316     not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
 11317     diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
 11318     thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou
 11319     liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
 11320     and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live
 11321     anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!          Exeunt
 11322 
 11323 
 11324 
 11325 
 11326 SCENE VII.
 11327 The forest
 11328 
 11329 A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
 11330 
 11331   DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;
 11332     For I can nowhere find him like a man.
 11333   FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
 11334     Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
 11335   DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
 11336     We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
 11337     Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
 11338 
 11339                          Enter JAQUES
 11340 
 11341   FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.
 11342   DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
 11343     That your poor friends must woo your company?
 11344     What, you look merrily!
 11345   JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
 11346     A motley fool. A miserable world!
 11347     As I do live by food, I met a fool,
 11348     Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
 11349     And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
 11350     In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
 11351     'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,
 11352     'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
 11353     And then he drew a dial from his poke,
 11354     And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
 11355     Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
 11356     Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;
 11357     'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
 11358     And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
 11359     And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
 11360     And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
 11361     And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
 11362     The motley fool thus moral on the time,
 11363     My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
 11364     That fools should be so deep contemplative;
 11365     And I did laugh sans intermission
 11366     An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
 11367     A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
 11368   DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?
 11369   JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
 11370     And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
 11371     They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
 11372     Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
 11373     After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
 11374     With observation, the which he vents
 11375     In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
 11376     I am ambitious for a motley coat.
 11377   DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
 11378   JAQUES. It is my only suit,
 11379     Provided that you weed your better judgments
 11380     Of all opinion that grows rank in them
 11381     That I am wise. I must have liberty
 11382     Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
 11383     To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
 11384     And they that are most galled with my folly,
 11385     They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
 11386     The why is plain as way to parish church:
 11387     He that a fool doth very wisely hit
 11388     Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
 11389     Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
 11390     The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
 11391     Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
 11392     Invest me in my motley; give me leave
 11393     To speak my mind, and I will through and through
 11394     Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
 11395     If they will patiently receive my medicine.
 11396   DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
 11397   JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?
 11398   DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
 11399     For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
 11400     As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
 11401     And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
 11402     That thou with license of free foot hast caught
 11403     Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
 11404   JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride
 11405     That can therein tax any private party?
 11406     Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
 11407     Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
 11408     What woman in the city do I name
 11409     When that I say the city-woman bears
 11410     The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
 11411     Who can come in and say that I mean her,
 11412     When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
 11413     Or what is he of basest function
 11414     That says his bravery is not on my cost,
 11415     Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
 11416     His folly to the mettle of my speech?
 11417     There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
 11418     My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
 11419     Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
 11420     Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
 11421     Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
 11422 
 11423              Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
 11424 
 11425   ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
 11426   JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.
 11427   ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
 11428   JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?
 11429   DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
 11430     Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
 11431     That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
 11432   ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
 11433     Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
 11434     Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,
 11435     And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
 11436     He dies that touches any of this fruit
 11437     Till I and my affairs are answered.
 11438   JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
 11439   DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
 11440     More than your force move us to gentleness.
 11441   ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
 11442   DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
 11443   ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
 11444     I thought that all things had been savage here,
 11445     And therefore put I on the countenance
 11446     Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
 11447     That in this desert inaccessible,
 11448     Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
 11449     Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
 11450     If ever you have look'd on better days,
 11451     If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
 11452     If ever sat at any good man's feast,
 11453     If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
 11454     And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
 11455     Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;
 11456     In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
 11457   DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
 11458     And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
 11459     And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
 11460     Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;
 11461     And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
 11462     And take upon command what help we have
 11463     That to your wanting may be minist'red.
 11464   ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
 11465     Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
 11466     And give it food. There is an old poor man
 11467     Who after me hath many a weary step
 11468     Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,
 11469     Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
 11470     I will not touch a bit.
 11471   DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.
 11472     And we will nothing waste till you return.
 11473   ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
 11474  Exit
 11475   DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
 11476     This wide and universal theatre
 11477     Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
 11478     Wherein we play in.
 11479   JAQUES. All the world's a stage,
 11480     And all the men and women merely players;
 11481     They have their exits and their entrances;
 11482     And one man in his time plays many parts,
 11483     His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
 11484     Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
 11485     Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
 11486     And shining morning face, creeping like snail
 11487     Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
 11488     Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
 11489     Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
 11490     Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
 11491     Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
 11492     Seeking the bubble reputation
 11493     Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
 11494     In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
 11495     With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
 11496     Full of wise saws and modern instances;
 11497     And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
 11498     Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
 11499     With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
 11500     His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
 11501     For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
 11502     Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
 11503     And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
 11504     That ends this strange eventful history,
 11505     Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
 11506     Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
 11507 
 11508                   Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM
 11509 
 11510   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
 11511     And let him feed.
 11512   ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.
 11513   ADAM. So had you need;
 11514     I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
 11515   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
 11516     As yet to question you about your fortunes.
 11517     Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
 11518 
 11519                          SONG
 11520             Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
 11521             Thou art not so unkind
 11522               As man's ingratitude;
 11523             Thy tooth is not so keen,
 11524             Because thou art not seen,
 11525               Although thy breath be rude.
 11526     Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.
 11527     Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
 11528             Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
 11529               This life is most jolly.
 11530 
 11531             Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
 11532             That dost not bite so nigh
 11533               As benefits forgot;
 11534             Though thou the waters warp,
 11535             Thy sting is not so sharp
 11536               As friend rememb'red not.
 11537     Heigh-ho! sing, &c.
 11538 
 11539   DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
 11540     As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
 11541     And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
 11542     Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
 11543     Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
 11544     That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
 11545     Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
 11546     Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
 11547     Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
 11548     And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt
 11549 
 11550 
 11551

 11553 ACT III. SCENE I.
 11554 The palace
 11555 
 11556 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS
 11557 
 11558   FREDERICK. Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
 11559     But were I not the better part made mercy,
 11560     I should not seek an absent argument
 11561     Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
 11562     Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
 11563     Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
 11564     Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
 11565     To seek a living in our territory.
 11566     Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
 11567     Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
 11568     Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
 11569     Of what we think against thee.
 11570   OLIVER. O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
 11571     I never lov'd my brother in my life.
 11572   FREDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
 11573     And let my officers of such a nature
 11574     Make an extent upon his house and lands.
 11575     Do this expediently, and turn him going.              Exeunt
 11576 
 11577 
 11578 
 11579 
 11580 SCENE II.
 11581 The forest
 11582 
 11583 Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
 11584 
 11585   ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
 11586     And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
 11587     With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
 11588     Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
 11589     O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
 11590     And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
 11591     That every eye which in this forest looks
 11592     Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
 11593     Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,
 11594     The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit
 11595 
 11596                      Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
 11597 
 11598   CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
 11599   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
 11600     life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
 11601     In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in
 11602     respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in
 11603     respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
 11604     it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,
 11605     look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
 11606     in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in
 11607     thee, shepherd?
 11608   CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
 11609     ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
 11610     without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
 11611     and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
 11612     great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
 11613     learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
 11614     or comes of a very dull kindred.
 11615   TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
 11616     court, shepherd?
 11617   CORIN. No, truly.
 11618   TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
 11619   CORIN. Nay, I hope.
 11620   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
 11621     one side.
 11622   CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
 11623   TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
 11624     manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
 11625     be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art
 11626     in a parlous state, shepherd.
 11627   CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
 11628     court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
 11629     country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not
 11630     at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
 11631     uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
 11632   TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
 11633   CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
 11634     know, are greasy.
 11635   TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
 11636     grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,
 11637     shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
 11638   CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
 11639   TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
 11640     more sounder instance; come.
 11641   CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
 11642     sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are
 11643     perfum'd with civet.
 11644   TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
 11645     piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
 11646     of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend
 11647     the instance, shepherd.
 11648   CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
 11649   TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God
 11650     make incision in thee! thou art raw.
 11651   CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I
 11652     wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
 11653     men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is
 11654     to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
 11655   TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes
 11656     and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
 11657     copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray
 11658     a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
 11659     out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,
 11660     the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how
 11661     thou shouldst scape.
 11662   CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
 11663 
 11664                   Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper
 11665 
 11666   ROSALIND.   'From the east to western Inde,
 11667               No jewel is like Rosalinde.
 11668               Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
 11669               Through all the world bears Rosalinde.
 11670               All the pictures fairest lin'd
 11671               Are but black to Rosalinde.
 11672               Let no face be kept in mind
 11673               But the fair of Rosalinde.'
 11674   TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and
 11675     suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right
 11676     butter-women's rank to market.
 11677   ROSALIND. Out, fool!
 11678   TOUCHSTONE.   For a taste:
 11679                 If a hart do lack a hind,
 11680                 Let him seek out Rosalinde.
 11681                 If the cat will after kind,
 11682                 So be sure will Rosalinde.
 11683                 Winter garments must be lin'd,
 11684                 So must slender Rosalinde.
 11685                 They that reap must sheaf and bind,
 11686                 Then to cart with Rosalinde.
 11687                 Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
 11688                 Such a nut is Rosalinde.
 11689                 He that sweetest rose will find
 11690                 Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.
 11691     This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect
 11692     yourself with them?
 11693   ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
 11694   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
 11695   ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a
 11696     medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for
 11697     you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right
 11698     virtue of the medlar.
 11699   TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest
 11700     judge.
 11701 
 11702                       Enter CELIA, with a writing
 11703 
 11704   ROSALIND. Peace!
 11705     Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
 11706   CELIA.   'Why should this a desert be?
 11707              For it is unpeopled? No;
 11708            Tongues I'll hang on every tree
 11709              That shall civil sayings show.
 11710            Some, how brief the life of man
 11711              Runs his erring pilgrimage,
 11712            That the streching of a span
 11713              Buckles in his sum of age;
 11714            Some, of violated vows
 11715              'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
 11716            But upon the fairest boughs,
 11717              Or at every sentence end,
 11718            Will I Rosalinda write,
 11719              Teaching all that read to know
 11720            The quintessence of every sprite
 11721              Heaven would in little show.
 11722            Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
 11723              That one body should be fill'd
 11724            With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
 11725              Nature presently distill'd
 11726            Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
 11727              Cleopatra's majesty,
 11728            Atalanta's better part,
 11729              Sad Lucretia's modesty.
 11730            Thus Rosalinde of many parts
 11731              By heavenly synod was devis'd,
 11732            Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
 11733              To have the touches dearest priz'd.
 11734            Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
 11735            And I to live and die her slave.'
 11736   ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have
 11737     you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
 11738     patience, good people.'
 11739   CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
 11740     him, sirrah.
 11741   TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
 11742     though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
 11743                                      Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
 11744   CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
 11745   ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
 11746     had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
 11747   CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
 11748   ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
 11749     without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
 11750   CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
 11751     hang'd and carved upon these trees?
 11752   ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
 11753     came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
 11754     berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I
 11755     can hardly remember.
 11756   CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?
 11757   ROSALIND. Is it a man?
 11758   CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
 11759     Change you colour?
 11760   ROSALIND. I prithee, who?
 11761   CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
 11762     mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
 11763   ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?
 11764   CELIA. Is it possible?
 11765   ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
 11766     me who it is.
 11767   CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
 11768     again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
 11769   ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
 11770     caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
 11771     disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
 11772     I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
 11773     thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man
 11774     out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-
 11775     either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork
 11776     out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
 11777   CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
 11778   ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
 11779     Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
 11780   CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.
 11781   ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let
 11782     me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the
 11783     knowledge of his chin.
 11784   CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
 11785     and your heart both in an instant.
 11786   ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
 11787     maid.
 11788   CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
 11789   ROSALIND. Orlando?
 11790   CELIA. Orlando.
 11791   ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
 11792     What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
 11793     Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where
 11794     remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
 11795     again? Answer me in one word.
 11796   CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
 11797     great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these
 11798     particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
 11799   ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
 11800     apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
 11801   CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
 11802     propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and
 11803     relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a
 11804     dropp'd acorn.
 11805   ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
 11806     such fruit.
 11807   CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.
 11808   ROSALIND. Proceed.
 11809   CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
 11810   ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
 11811     the ground.
 11812   CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
 11813     unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
 11814   ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
 11815   CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
 11816     of tune.
 11817   ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
 11818     Sweet, say on.
 11819   CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
 11820 
 11821                    Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
 11822 
 11823   ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
 11824   JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
 11825     lief have been myself alone.
 11826   ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
 11827     for your society.
 11828   JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
 11829   ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
 11830   JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
 11831     their barks.
 11832   ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
 11833     ill-favouredly.
 11834   JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
 11835   ORLANDO. Yes, just.
 11836   JAQUES. I do not like her name.
 11837   ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
 11838     christen'd.
 11839   JAQUES. What stature is she of?
 11840   ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.
 11841   JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
 11842     acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
 11843   ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
 11844     you have studied your questions.
 11845   JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
 11846     heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
 11847     our mistress the world, and all our misery.
 11848   ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
 11849     whom I know most faults.
 11850   JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
 11851   ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
 11852     weary of you.
 11853   JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
 11854   ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
 11855     him.
 11856   JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
 11857   ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
 11858   JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
 11859   ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
 11860     Melancholy.
 11861                                                      Exit JAQUES
 11862   ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
 11863     and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,
 11864     forester?
 11865   ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?
 11866   ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
 11867   ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
 11868     the forest.
 11869   ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
 11870     every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
 11871     of Time as well as a clock.
 11872   ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
 11873     proper?
 11874   ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
 11875     divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time
 11876     trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still
 11877     withal.
 11878   ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
 11879   ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
 11880     contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
 11881     interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems
 11882     the length of seven year.
 11883   ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
 11884   ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
 11885     not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,
 11886     and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
 11887     lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other
 11888     knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles
 11889     withal.
 11890   ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
 11891   ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
 11892     as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
 11893   ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?
 11894   ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
 11895     and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
 11896   ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
 11897   ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
 11898     the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
 11899   ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?
 11900   ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
 11901   ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
 11902     so removed a dwelling.
 11903   ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
 11904     uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland
 11905     man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
 11906     I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I
 11907     am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
 11908     hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
 11909   ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
 11910     to the charge of women?
 11911   ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
 11912     as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
 11913     fellow-fault came to match it.
 11914   ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
 11915   ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
 11916     sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
 11917     plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon
 11918     hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the
 11919     name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give
 11920     him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
 11921     upon him.
 11922   ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
 11923     remedy.
 11924   ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
 11925     how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you
 11926     are not prisoner.
 11927   ORLANDO. What were his marks?
 11928   ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
 11929     which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
 11930     a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
 11931     for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
 11932     Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
 11933     sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you
 11934     demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you
 11935     are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself
 11936     than seeming the lover of any other.
 11937   ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
 11938   ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
 11939     believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
 11940     she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give
 11941     the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that
 11942     hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
 11943   ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
 11944     am that he, that unfortunate he.
 11945   ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
 11946   ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
 11947   ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
 11948     well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
 11949     they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
 11950     ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing
 11951     it by counsel.
 11952   ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
 11953   ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
 11954     love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which
 11955     time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
 11956     changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
 11957     shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
 11958     passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
 11959     women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
 11960     him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now
 11961     weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his
 11962     mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
 11963     forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
 11964     merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
 11965     upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
 11966     that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
 11967   ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
 11968   ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
 11969     come every day to my cote and woo me.
 11970   ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
 11971   ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
 11972     you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
 11973   ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
 11974   ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
 11975     go?                                                   Exeunt
 11976 
 11977 
 11978 
 11979 
 11980 SCENE III.
 11981 The forest
 11982 
 11983 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
 11984 
 11985   TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
 11986     Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
 11987     content you?
 11988   AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
 11989   TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
 11990     capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
 11991   JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
 11992     thatch'd house!
 11993   TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
 11994     good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
 11995     strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
 11996     Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
 11997   AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
 11998     word? Is it a true thing?
 11999   TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
 12000     and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
 12001     be said as lovers they do feign.
 12002   AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
 12003   TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
 12004     now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst
 12005     feign.
 12006   AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
 12007   TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
 12008     coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
 12009   JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!
 12010   AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
 12011     honest.
 12012   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
 12013     to put good meat into an unclean dish.
 12014   AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
 12015   TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
 12016     sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will
 12017     marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,
 12018     the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
 12019     this place of the forest, and to couple us.
 12020   JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
 12021   AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
 12022   TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
 12023     in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
 12024     assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
 12025     odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
 12026     of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
 12027     of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
 12028     own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
 12029     deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
 12030     blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
 12031     is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
 12032     brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
 12033     skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes
 12034     Sir Oliver.
 12035 
 12036                        Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
 12037 
 12038     Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here
 12039     under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
 12040   MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
 12041   TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
 12042   MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
 12043   JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
 12044   TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
 12045     You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am
 12046     very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be
 12047     cover'd.
 12048   JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?
 12049   TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
 12050     the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
 12051     bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
 12052   JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
 12053     under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good
 12054     priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but
 12055     join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
 12056     prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
 12057   TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
 12058     married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
 12059     well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
 12060     hereafter to leave my wife.
 12061   JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
 12062   TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
 12063     We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
 12064     Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-
 12065                O sweet Oliver,
 12066                O brave Oliver,
 12067            Leave me not behind thee.
 12068     But-
 12069                  Wind away,
 12070                Begone, I say,
 12071            I will not to wedding with thee.
 12072                            Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
 12073   MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
 12074     shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit
 12075 
 12076 
 12077 
 12078 
 12079 SCENE IV.
 12080 The forest
 12081 
 12082 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
 12083 
 12084   ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
 12085   CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
 12086     do not become a man.
 12087   ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
 12088   CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
 12089   ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
 12090   CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.
 12091     Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
 12092   ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
 12093   CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
 12094   ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
 12095     holy bread.
 12096   CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
 12097     winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
 12098     chastity is in them.
 12099   ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
 12100     comes not?
 12101   CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
 12102   ROSALIND. Do you think so?
 12103   CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
 12104     for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
 12105     goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
 12106   ROSALIND. Not true in love?
 12107   CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
 12108   ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
 12109   CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
 12110     stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
 12111     of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,
 12112     your father.
 12113   ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
 12114     He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
 12115     he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
 12116     there is such a man as Orlando?
 12117   CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
 12118     words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
 12119     traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
 12120     spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
 12121     goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who
 12122     comes here?
 12123 
 12124                          Enter CORIN
 12125 
 12126   CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
 12127     After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
 12128     Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
 12129     Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
 12130     That was his mistress.
 12131   CELIA. Well, and what of him?
 12132   CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
 12133     Between the pale complexion of true love
 12134     And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
 12135     Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
 12136     If you will mark it.
 12137   ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!
 12138     The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
 12139     Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
 12140     I'll prove a busy actor in their play.                Exeunt
 12141 
 12142 
 12143 
 12144 
 12145 SCENE V.
 12146 Another part of the forest
 12147 
 12148 Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
 12149 
 12150   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
 12151     Say that you love me not; but say not so
 12152     In bitterness. The common executioner,
 12153     Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
 12154     Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
 12155     But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
 12156     Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
 12157 
 12158           Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance
 12159 
 12160   PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;
 12161     I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
 12162     Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
 12163     'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
 12164     That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
 12165     Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
 12166     Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
 12167     Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
 12168     And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
 12169     Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
 12170     Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
 12171     Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
 12172     Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
 12173     Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
 12174     Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
 12175     The cicatrice and capable impressure
 12176     Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
 12177     Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
 12178     Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
 12179     That can do hurt.
 12180   SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,
 12181     If ever- as that ever may be near-
 12182     You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
 12183     Then shall you know the wounds invisible
 12184     That love's keen arrows make.
 12185   PHEBE. But till that time
 12186     Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
 12187     Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
 12188     As till that time I shall not pity thee.
 12189   ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
 12190       mother,
 12191     That you insult, exult, and all at once,
 12192     Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-
 12193     As, by my faith, I see no more in you
 12194     Than without candle may go dark to bed-
 12195     Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
 12196     Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
 12197     I see no more in you than in the ordinary
 12198     Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
 12199     I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
 12200     No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;
 12201     'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
 12202     Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
 12203     That can entame my spirits to your worship.
 12204     You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
 12205     Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
 12206     You are a thousand times a properer man
 12207     Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
 12208     That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
 12209     'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
 12210     And out of you she sees herself more proper
 12211     Than any of her lineaments can show her.
 12212     But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,
 12213     And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
 12214     For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
 12215     Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
 12216     Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
 12217     Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
 12218     So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
 12219   PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
 12220     I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
 12221   ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
 12222     in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee
 12223     with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look
 12224     you so upon me?
 12225   PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.
 12226   ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
 12227     For I am falser than vows made in wine;
 12228     Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
 12229     'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
 12230     Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
 12231     Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
 12232     And be not proud; though all the world could see,
 12233     None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
 12234     Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
 12235   PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
 12236     'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'
 12237   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
 12238   PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
 12239   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
 12240   PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
 12241   SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
 12242     If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
 12243     By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
 12244     Were both extermin'd.
 12245   PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
 12246   SILVIUS. I would have you.
 12247   PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.
 12248     Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
 12249     And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
 12250     But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
 12251     Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
 12252     I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
 12253     But do not look for further recompense
 12254     Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
 12255   SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
 12256     And I in such a poverty of grace,
 12257     That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
 12258     To glean the broken ears after the man
 12259     That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
 12260     A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
 12261   PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
 12262   SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
 12263     And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
 12264     That the old carlot once was master of.
 12265   PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
 12266     'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
 12267     But what care I for words? Yet words do well
 12268     When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
 12269     It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
 12270     But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
 12271     He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
 12272     Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
 12273     Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
 12274     He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
 12275     His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
 12276     There was a pretty redness in his lip,
 12277     A little riper and more lusty red
 12278     Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
 12279     Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
 12280     There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
 12281     In parcels as I did, would have gone near
 12282     To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
 12283     I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
 12284     I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
 12285     For what had he to do to chide at me?
 12286     He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
 12287     And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
 12288     I marvel why I answer'd not again;
 12289     But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
 12290     I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
 12291     And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
 12292   SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
 12293   PHEBE. I'll write it straight;
 12294     The matter's in my head and in my heart;
 12295     I will be bitter with him and passing short.
 12296     Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt

 12312 ACT IV. SCENE I.
 12313 The forest
 12314 
 12315 Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
 12316 
 12317   JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
 12318     thee.
 12319   ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
 12320   JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
 12321   ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
 12322     fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
 12323     drunkards.
 12324   JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
 12325   ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
 12326   JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
 12327     emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
 12328     courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
 12329     ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
 12330     which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
 12331     melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
 12332     from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
 12333     travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
 12334     sadness.
 12335   ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
 12336     sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
 12337     to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
 12338     poor hands.
 12339   JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
 12340 
 12341                         Enter ORLANDO
 12342 
 12343   ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
 12344     fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
 12345     travel for it too.
 12346   ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
 12347   JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
 12348   ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
 12349     strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
 12350     out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
 12351     you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
 12352     swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
 12353     have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
 12354     another trick, never come in my sight more.
 12355   ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
 12356   ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
 12357     minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
 12358     thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said
 12359     of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
 12360     warrant him heart-whole.
 12361   ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
 12362   ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
 12363     as lief be woo'd of a snail.
 12364   ORLANDO. Of a snail!
 12365   ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
 12366     his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
 12367     a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
 12368   ORLANDO. What's that?
 12369   ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
 12370     your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
 12371     the slander of his wife.
 12372   ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
 12373   ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
 12374   CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
 12375     better leer than you.
 12376   ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
 12377     and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I
 12378     were your very very Rosalind?
 12379   ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
 12380   ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
 12381     gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
 12382     Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
 12383     lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
 12384     kiss.
 12385   ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
 12386   ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
 12387     matter.
 12388   ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
 12389   ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
 12390     should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
 12391   ORLANDO. What, of my suit?
 12392   ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
 12393     Am not I your Rosalind?
 12394   ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
 12395     of her.
 12396   ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
 12397   ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
 12398   ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
 12399     thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
 12400     died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
 12401     his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
 12402     could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
 12403     Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had
 12404     turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,
 12405     good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
 12406     being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
 12407     chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these
 12408     are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
 12409     eaten them, but not for love.
 12410   ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
 12411     protest, her frown might kill me.
 12412   ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
 12413     will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me
 12414     what you will, I will grant it.
 12415   ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
 12416   ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
 12417   ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
 12418   ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
 12419   ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
 12420   ROSALIND. Are you not good?
 12421   ORLANDO. I hope so.
 12422   ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
 12423     sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
 12424     Orlando. What do you say, sister?
 12425   ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
 12426   CELIA. I cannot say the words.
 12427   ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
 12428   CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
 12429   ORLANDO. I will.
 12430   ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
 12431   ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
 12432   ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
 12433   ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
 12434   ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
 12435     Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
 12436     and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
 12437   ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
 12438   ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
 12439     possess'd her.
 12440   ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
 12441   ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
 12442     April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
 12443     they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
 12444     be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
 12445     more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
 12446     an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for
 12447     nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
 12448     are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
 12449     thou are inclin'd to sleep.
 12450   ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
 12451   ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
 12452   ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.
 12453   ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
 12454     the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
 12455     at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
 12456     that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
 12457   ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
 12458     whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your
 12459     wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
 12460   ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
 12461   ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
 12462     take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
 12463     tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
 12464     occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
 12465     breed it like a fool!
 12466   ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
 12467   ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
 12468   ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
 12469     with thee again.
 12470   ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
 12471     prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That
 12472     flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and
 12473     so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
 12474   ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
 12475   ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
 12476     by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
 12477     of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
 12478     think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
 12479     lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
 12480     be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore
 12481     beware my censure, and keep your promise.
 12482   ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
 12483     Rosalind; so, adieu.
 12484   ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
 12485     offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
 12486   CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
 12487     have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
 12488     world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
 12489   ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
 12490     know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;
 12491     my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
 12492   CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
 12493     in, it runs out.
 12494   ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
 12495     thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
 12496     rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are
 12497     out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
 12498     Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
 12499     shadow, and sigh till he come.
 12500   CELIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt

 12506 The forest
 12507 
 12508         Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters
 12509 
 12510   JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
 12511   LORD. Sir, it was I.
 12512   JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
 12513     it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
 12514     branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
 12515   LORD. Yes, sir.
 12516   JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
 12517     enough.
 12518 
 12519                     SONG.
 12520 
 12521       What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
 12522       His leather skin and horns to wear.
 12523                               [The rest shall hear this burden:]
 12524            Then sing him home.
 12525 
 12526       Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
 12527       It was a crest ere thou wast born.
 12528            Thy father's father wore it;
 12529            And thy father bore it.
 12530       The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
 12531       Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.                   Exeunt

 12537 The forest
 12538 
 12539 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
 12540 
 12541   ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
 12542     And here much Orlando!
 12543   CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
 12544     ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
 12545     comes here.
 12546 
 12547                       Enter SILVIUS
 12548 
 12549   SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
 12550     My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
 12551     I know not the contents; but, as I guess
 12552     By the stern brow and waspish action
 12553     Which she did use as she was writing of it,
 12554     It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
 12555     I am but as a guiltless messenger.
 12556   ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
 12557     And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
 12558     She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
 12559     She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
 12560     Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
 12561     Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
 12562     Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
 12563     This is a letter of your own device.
 12564   SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
 12565     Phebe did write it.
 12566   ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
 12567     And turn'd into the extremity of love.
 12568     I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
 12569     A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
 12570     That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
 12571     She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
 12572     I say she never did invent this letter:
 12573     This is a man's invention, and his hand.
 12574   SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
 12575   ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
 12576     A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
 12577     Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
 12578     Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
 12579     Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
 12580     Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
 12581   SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
 12582     Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
 12583   ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
 12584                                                          [Reads]
 12585 
 12586             'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
 12587             That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
 12588 
 12589     Can a woman rail thus?
 12590   SILVIUS. Call you this railing?
 12591   ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
 12592              Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
 12593 
 12594     Did you ever hear such railing?
 12595 
 12596             'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
 12597             That could do no vengeance to me.'
 12598 
 12599     Meaning me a beast.
 12600 
 12601             'If the scorn of your bright eyne
 12602             Have power to raise such love in mine,
 12603             Alack, in me what strange effect
 12604             Would they work in mild aspect!
 12605             Whiles you chid me, I did love;
 12606             How then might your prayers move!
 12607             He that brings this love to the
 12608             Little knows this love in me;
 12609             And by him seal up thy mind,
 12610             Whether that thy youth and kind
 12611             Will the faithful offer take
 12612             Of me and all that I can make;
 12613             Or else by him my love deny,
 12614             And then I'll study how to die.'
 12615   SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?
 12616   CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
 12617   ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
 12618     such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
 12619     strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
 12620     for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
 12621     that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
 12622     I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
 12623     true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
 12624                                                     Exit SILVIUS
 12625 
 12626                          Enter OLIVER
 12627 
 12628   OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
 12629     Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
 12630     A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
 12631   CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
 12632     The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
 12633     Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
 12634     But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
 12635     There's none within.
 12636   OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
 12637     Then should I know you by description-
 12638     Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,
 12639     Of female favour, and bestows himself
 12640     Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
 12641     And browner than her brother.' Are not you
 12642     The owner of the house I did inquire for?
 12643   CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
 12644   OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
 12645     And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
 12646     He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
 12647   ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
 12648   OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
 12649     What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
 12650     This handkercher was stain'd.
 12651   CELIA. I pray you, tell it.
 12652   OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
 12653     He left a promise to return again
 12654     Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
 12655     Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
 12656     Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
 12657     And mark what object did present itself.
 12658     Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
 12659     And high top bald with dry antiquity,
 12660     A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
 12661     Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
 12662     A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
 12663     Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
 12664     The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
 12665     Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
 12666     And with indented glides did slip away
 12667     Into a bush; under which bush's shade
 12668     A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
 12669     Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
 12670     When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
 12671     The royal disposition of that beast
 12672     To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
 12673     This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
 12674     And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
 12675   CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
 12676     And he did render him the most unnatural
 12677     That liv'd amongst men.
 12678   OLIVER. And well he might so do,
 12679     For well I know he was unnatural.
 12680   ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
 12681     Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
 12682   OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
 12683     But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
 12684     And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
 12685     Made him give battle to the lioness,
 12686     Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
 12687     From miserable slumber I awak'd.
 12688   CELIA. Are you his brother?
 12689   ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
 12690   CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
 12691   OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
 12692     To tell you what I was, since my conversion
 12693     So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
 12694   ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
 12695   OLIVER. By and by.
 12696     When from the first to last, betwixt us two,
 12697     Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
 12698     As how I came into that desert place-
 12699     In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
 12700     Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
 12701     Committing me unto my brother's love;
 12702     Who led me instantly unto his cave,
 12703     There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
 12704     The lioness had torn some flesh away,
 12705     Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
 12706     And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
 12707     Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
 12708     And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
 12709     He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
 12710     To tell this story, that you might excuse
 12711     His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
 12712     Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
 12713     That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
 12714                                                [ROSALIND swoons]
 12715   CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
 12716   OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
 12717   CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
 12718   OLIVER. Look, he recovers.
 12719   ROSALIND. I would I were at home.
 12720   CELIA. We'll lead you thither.
 12721     I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
 12722   OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
 12723     You lack a man's heart.
 12724   ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
 12725     this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how
 12726     well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
 12727   OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
 12728     your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
 12729   ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
 12730   OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
 12731   ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
 12732     right.
 12733   CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
 12734     Good sir, go with us.
 12735   OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
 12736     How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
 12737   ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
 12738     counterfeiting to him. Will you go?                   Exeunt

 12754 ACT V. SCENE I.
 12755 The forest
 12756 
 12757 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
 12758 
 12759   TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
 12760   AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
 12761     gentleman's saying.
 12762   TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
 12763     But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
 12764     you.
 12765   AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
 12766     world; here comes the man you mean.
 12767 
 12768                          Enter WILLIAM
 12769 
 12770   TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,
 12771     we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
 12772     flouting; we cannot hold.
 12773   WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.
 12774   AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.
 12775   WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.
 12776   TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
 12777     head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
 12778   WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
 12779   TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
 12780   WILLIAM. William, sir.
 12781   TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
 12782   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
 12783   TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
 12784     Art rich?
 12785   WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
 12786   TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
 12787     yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
 12788   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
 12789   TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The
 12790     fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
 12791     a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a
 12792     grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning
 12793     thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
 12794     love this maid?
 12795   WILLIAM. I do, sir.
 12796   TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
 12797   WILLIAM. No, sir.
 12798   TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
 12799     figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
 12800     glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
 12801     writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
 12802     am he.
 12803   WILLIAM. Which he, sir?
 12804   TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
 12805     clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which
 12806     in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
 12807     woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
 12808     clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
 12809     or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
 12810     death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
 12811     or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
 12812     will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
 12813     fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
 12814   AUDREY. Do, good William.
 12815   WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit
 12816 
 12817                           Enter CORIN
 12818 
 12819   CORIN. Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
 12820   TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
 12821                                                           Exeunt

 12825 
 12826 SCENE II.
 12827 The forest
 12828 
 12829 Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
 12830 
 12831   ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
 12832     like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
 12833     and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
 12834     her?
 12835   OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
 12836     of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden
 12837     consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
 12838     loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
 12839     shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue
 12840     that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live
 12841     and die a shepherd.
 12842   ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
 12843     Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers. Go
 12844     you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
 12845 
 12846                         Enter ROSALIND
 12847 
 12848   ROSALIND. God save you, brother.
 12849   OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
 12850   ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
 12851     thy heart in a scarf!
 12852   ORLANDO. It is my arm.
 12853   ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
 12854     lion.
 12855   ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
 12856   ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
 12857     when he show'd me your handkercher?
 12858   ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
 12859   ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
 12860     any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's
 12861     thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother
 12862     and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but
 12863     they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but
 12864     they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
 12865     they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair
 12866     of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else
 12867     be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of
 12868     love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
 12869   ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
 12870     to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
 12871     happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I
 12872     to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
 12873     shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
 12874   ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
 12875     Rosalind?
 12876   ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
 12877   ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
 12878     of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
 12879     a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should
 12880     bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you
 12881     are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
 12882     little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and
 12883     not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do
 12884     strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
 12885     with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
 12886     If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
 12887     it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I
 12888     know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
 12889     impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
 12890     her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
 12891     danger.
 12892   ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
 12893   ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
 12894     am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
 12895     friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
 12896     Rosalind, if you will.
 12897 
 12898                      Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
 12899 
 12900     Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
 12901   PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
 12902     To show the letter that I writ to you.
 12903   ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
 12904     To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
 12905     You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
 12906     Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
 12907   PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
 12908   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
 12909     And so am I for Phebe.
 12910   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
 12911   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
 12912   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
 12913   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
 12914     And so am I for Phebe.
 12915   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
 12916   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
 12917   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
 12918   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
 12919     All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
 12920     All adoration, duty, and observance,
 12921     All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
 12922     All purity, all trial, all obedience;
 12923     And so am I for Phebe.
 12924   PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
 12925   ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
 12926   ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.
 12927   PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
 12928   SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
 12929   ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
 12930   ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
 12931   ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
 12932   ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
 12933     wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
 12934     [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all
 12935     together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,
 12936     and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
 12937     ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To
 12938     Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and
 12939     you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love
 12940     Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
 12941     love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
 12942     commands.
 12943   SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
 12944   PHEBE. Nor I.
 12945   ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt
 12946

 12949 
 12950 SCENE III.
 12951 The forest
 12952 
 12953 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
 12954 
 12955   TOUCHSTONE. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we
 12956     be married.
 12957   AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
 12958     dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come
 12959     two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
 12960 
 12961                             Enter two PAGES
 12962 
 12963   FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.
 12964   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
 12965   SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
 12966   FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or
 12967     spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues
 12968     to a bad voice?
 12969   SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
 12970     on a horse.
 12971 
 12972                       SONG.
 12973         It was a lover and his lass,
 12974           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
 12975         That o'er the green corn-field did pass
 12976           In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
 12977         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
 12978         Sweet lovers love the spring.
 12979 
 12980         Between the acres of the rye,
 12981           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
 12982         These pretty country folks would lie,
 12983           In the spring time, &c.
 12984 
 12985         This carol they began that hour,
 12986           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
 12987         How that a life was but a flower,
 12988           In the spring time, &c.
 12989 
 12990         And therefore take the present time,
 12991           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
 12992         For love is crowned with the prime,
 12993           In the spring time, &c.
 12994 
 12995   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
 12996     matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
 12997   FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
 12998     time.
 12999   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such
 13000     a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,
 13001     Audrey.                                               Exeunt

 13006 SCENE IV.
 13007 The forest
 13008 
 13009 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
 13010 
 13011   DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
 13012     Can do all this that he hath promised?
 13013   ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
 13014     As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
 13015 
 13016                Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
 13017 
 13018   ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
 13019     You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
 13020     You will bestow her on Orlando here?
 13021   DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
 13022   ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
 13023   ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
 13024   ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
 13025   PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
 13026   ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,
 13027     You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
 13028   PHEBE. So is the bargain.
 13029   ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
 13030   SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
 13031   ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
 13032     Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
 13033     You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
 13034     Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
 13035     Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
 13036     Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
 13037     If she refuse me; and from hence I go,
 13038     To make these doubts all even.
 13039                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
 13040   DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy
 13041     Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
 13042   ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
 13043     Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
 13044     But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
 13045     And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
 13046     Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
 13047     Whom he reports to be a great magician,
 13048     Obscured in the circle of this forest.
 13049 
 13050                     Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
 13051 
 13052   JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
 13053     coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
 13054     in all tongues are call'd fools.
 13055   TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
 13056   JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
 13057     gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
 13058      courtier, he swears.
 13059   TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
 13060     I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
 13061     politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
 13062     three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
 13063     one.
 13064   JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
 13065   TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
 13066     seventh cause.
 13067   JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
 13068   DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
 13069   TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
 13070     here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
 13071     and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
 13072     poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
 13073     poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich
 13074     honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
 13075     in your foul oyster.
 13076   DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
 13077   TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
 13078     diseases.
 13079   JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
 13080     the seventh cause?
 13081   TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
 13082     seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain
 13083     courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
 13084     cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
 13085     Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
 13086     send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip
 13087     Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
 13088     This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,
 13089     he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof
 13090     Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This
 13091     is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
 13092     Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
 13093   JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
 13094   TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
 13095     he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
 13096     and parted.
 13097   JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
 13098   TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
 13099     books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,
 13100     the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
 13101     Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
 13102     Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
 13103     the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie
 13104     Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven
 13105     justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
 13106     met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you
 13107     said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore
 13108     brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
 13109   JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
 13110     He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
 13111   DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
 13112     presentation of that he shoots his wit:
 13113 
 13114           Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC
 13115 
 13116     HYMEN.    Then is there mirth in heaven,
 13117               When earthly things made even
 13118                 Atone together.
 13119               Good Duke, receive thy daughter;
 13120               Hymen from heaven brought her,
 13121                 Yea, brought her hither,
 13122               That thou mightst join her hand with his,
 13123               Whose heart within his bosom is.
 13124   ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
 13125     [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
 13126   DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
 13127   ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
 13128   PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,
 13129     Why then, my love adieu!
 13130   ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he;
 13131     I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
 13132     Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
 13133   HYMEN.    Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
 13134             'Tis I must make conclusion
 13135               Of these most strange events.
 13136             Here's eight that must take hands
 13137             To join in Hymen's bands,
 13138               If truth holds true contents.
 13139             You and you no cross shall part;
 13140             You and you are heart in heart;
 13141             You to his love must accord,
 13142             Or have a woman to your lord;
 13143             You and you are sure together,
 13144             As the winter to foul weather.
 13145             Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
 13146             Feed yourselves with questioning,
 13147             That reason wonder may diminish,
 13148             How thus we met, and these things finish.
 13149 
 13150                        SONG
 13151             Wedding is great Juno's crown;
 13152               O blessed bond of board and bed!
 13153             'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
 13154               High wedlock then be honoured.
 13155             Honour, high honour, and renown,
 13156             To Hymen, god of every town!
 13157 
 13158   DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
 13159     Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
 13160   PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
 13161     Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
 13162 
 13163                  Enter JAQUES de BOYS
 13164 
 13165   JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.
 13166     I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
 13167     That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
 13168     Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
 13169     Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
 13170     Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
 13171     In his own conduct, purposely to take
 13172     His brother here, and put him to the sword;
 13173     And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
 13174     Where, meeting with an old religious man,
 13175     After some question with him, was converted
 13176     Both from his enterprise and from the world;
 13177     His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
 13178     And all their lands restor'd to them again
 13179     That were with him exil'd. This to be true
 13180     I do engage my life.
 13181   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.
 13182     Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
 13183     To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
 13184     A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
 13185     First, in this forest let us do those ends
 13186     That here were well begun and well begot;
 13187     And after, every of this happy number,
 13188     That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
 13189     Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
 13190     According to the measure of their states.
 13191     Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
 13192     And fall into our rustic revelry.
 13193     Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
 13194     With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
 13195   JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
 13196     The Duke hath put on a religious life,
 13197     And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
 13198   JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.
 13199   JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites
 13200     There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
 13201     [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;
 13202     Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
 13203     [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
 13204     [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies
 13205     [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;
 13206     [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
 13207     Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;
 13208     I am for other than for dancing measures.
 13209   DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.
 13210   JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have
 13211     I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit
 13212   DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,
 13213     As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance] Exeunt
 13214 
 13215 EPILOGUE
 13216                            EPILOGUE.
 13217   ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but
 13218     it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it
 13219     be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play
 13220     needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
 13221     good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a
 13222     case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
 13223     insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
 13224     furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
 13225     way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge
 13226     you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
 13227     this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
 13228     you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
 13229     hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.
 13230     If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
 13231     pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied
 13232     not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,
 13233     or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
 13234     bid me farewell.
 13235

 13306 THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
 13307 
 13308 ACT I. SCENE 1
 13309 
 13310 A hall in the DUKE'S palace
 13311 
 13312 Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant
 13313 of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS
 13314 
 13315 AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
 13316   And by the doom of death end woes and all.
 13317 DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
 13318   I am not partial to infringe our laws.
 13319   The enmity and discord which of late
 13320   Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
 13321   To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
 13322   Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
 13323   Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
 13324   Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
 13325   For, since the mortal and intestine jars
 13326   'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
 13327   It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
 13328   Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
 13329   To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
 13330   Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus
 13331   Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
 13332   Again, if any Syracusian born
 13333   Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,
 13334   His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
 13335   Unless a thousand marks be levied,
 13336   To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
 13337   Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
 13338   Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
 13339   Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.
 13340 AEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
 13341   My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
 13342 DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
 13343   Why thou departed'st from thy native home,
 13344   And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
 13345 AEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos'd
 13346   Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
 13347   Yet, that the world may witness that my end
 13348   Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
 13349   I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
 13350   In Syracuse was I born, and wed
 13351   Unto a woman, happy but for me,
 13352   And by me, had not our hap been bad.
 13353   With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd
 13354   By prosperous voyages I often made
 13355   To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
 13356   And the great care of goods at random left,
 13357   Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
 13358   From whom my absence was not six months old,
 13359   Before herself, almost at fainting under
 13360   The pleasing punishment that women bear,
 13361   Had made provision for her following me,
 13362   And soon and safe arrived where I was.
 13363   There had she not been long but she became
 13364   A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
 13365   And, which was strange, the one so like the other
 13366   As could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
 13367   That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
 13368   A mean woman was delivered
 13369   Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
 13370   Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
 13371   I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
 13372   My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
 13373   Made daily motions for our home return;
 13374   Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon
 13375   We came aboard.
 13376   A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
 13377   Before the always-wind-obeying deep
 13378   Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
 13379   But longer did we not retain much hope,
 13380   For what obscured light the heavens did grant
 13381   Did but convey unto our fearful minds
 13382   A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
 13383   Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
 13384   Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
 13385   Weeping before for what she saw must come,
 13386   And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
 13387   That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
 13388   Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
 13389   And this it was, for other means was none:
 13390   The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
 13391   And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
 13392   My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
 13393   Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
 13394   Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
 13395   To him one of the other twins was bound,
 13396   Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
 13397   The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
 13398   Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
 13399   Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
 13400   And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
 13401   Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
 13402   At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
 13403   Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
 13404   And, by the benefit of his wished light,
 13405   The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
 13406   Two ships from far making amain to us-
 13407   Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
 13408   But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
 13409   Gather the sequel by that went before.
 13410 DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;
 13411   For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
 13412 AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now
 13413   Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
 13414   For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
 13415   We were encount'red by a mighty rock,
 13416   Which being violently borne upon,
 13417   Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
 13418   So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
 13419   Fortune had left to both of us alike
 13420   What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
 13421   Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened
 13422   With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
 13423   Was carried with more speed before the wind;
 13424   And in our sight they three were taken up
 13425   By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
 13426   At length another ship had seiz'd on us;
 13427   And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
 13428   Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,
 13429   And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
 13430   Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
 13431   And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
 13432   Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
 13433   That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
 13434   To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
 13435 DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
 13436   Do me the favour to dilate at full
 13437   What have befall'n of them and thee till now.
 13438 AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
 13439   At eighteen years became inquisitive
 13440   After his brother, and importun'd me
 13441   That his attendant-so his case was like,
 13442   Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-
 13443   Might bear him company in the quest of him;
 13444   Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
 13445   I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
 13446   Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
 13447   Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
 13448   And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
 13449   Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
 13450   Or that or any place that harbours men.
 13451   But here must end the story of my life;
 13452   And happy were I in my timely death,
 13453   Could all my travels warrant me they live.
 13454 DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
 13455   To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
 13456   Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
 13457   Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
 13458   Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
 13459   My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
 13460   But though thou art adjudged to the death,
 13461   And passed sentence may not be recall'd
 13462   But to our honour's great disparagement,
 13463   Yet will I favour thee in what I can.
 13464   Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
 13465   To seek thy help by beneficial hap.
 13466   Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
 13467   Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
 13468   And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
 13469   Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
 13470 GAOLER. I will, my lord.
 13471 AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
 13472   But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

 13476 SCENE 2
 13477 
 13478 The mart
 13479 
 13480 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST MERCHANT
 13481 
 13482 FIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
 13483   Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
 13484   This very day a Syracusian merchant
 13485   Is apprehended for arrival here;
 13486   And, not being able to buy out his life,
 13487   According to the statute of the town,
 13488   Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
 13489   There is your money that I had to keep.
 13490 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
 13491   And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
 13492   Within this hour it will be dinner-time;
 13493   Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
 13494   Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
 13495   And then return and sleep within mine inn;
 13496   For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
 13497   Get thee away.
 13498 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word,
 13499   And go indeed, having so good a mean.
 13500 <Exit
 13501 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
 13502   When I am dull with care and melancholy,
 13503   Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
 13504   What, will you walk with me about the town,
 13505   And then go to my inn and dine with me?
 13506 FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
 13507   Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
 13508   I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
 13509   Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
 13510   And afterward consort you till bed time.
 13511   My present business calls me from you now.
 13512 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
 13513   And wander up and down to view the city.
 13514 FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.
 13515 <Exit FIRST MERCHANT
 13516 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
 13517   Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
 13518   I to the world am like a drop of water
 13519   That in the ocean seeks another drop,
 13520   Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
 13521   Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
 13522   So I, to find a mother and a brother,
 13523   In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
 13524 
 13525 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
 13526 
 13527   Here comes the almanac of my true date.
 13528   What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?
 13529 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late.
 13530   The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
 13531   The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell-
 13532   My mistress made it one upon my cheek;
 13533   She is so hot because the meat is cold,
 13534   The meat is cold because you come not home,
 13535   You come not home because you have no stomach,
 13536   You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
 13537   But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
 13538   Are penitent for your default to-day.
 13539 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
 13540   Where have you left the money that I gave you?
 13541 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last
 13542   To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
 13543   The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
 13544 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
 13545   Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
 13546   We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
 13547   So great a charge from thine own custody?
 13548 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
 13549   I from my mistress come to you in post;
 13550   If I return, I shall be post indeed,
 13551   For she will score your fault upon my pate.
 13552   Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
 13553   And strike you home without a messenger.
 13554 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
 13555   Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
 13556   Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
 13557 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.
 13558   ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
 13559   And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
 13560 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
 13561   Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
 13562   My mistress and her sister stays for you.
 13563 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
 13564   In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
 13565   Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
 13566   That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
 13567   Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
 13568 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
 13569   Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
 13570   But not a thousand marks between you both.
 13571   If I should pay your worship those again,
 13572   Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
 13573 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
 13574 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
 13575   She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
 13576   And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
 13577 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
 13578   Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
 13579 [Beats him]
 13580 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands!
 13581   Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
 13582 <Exit
 13583 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
 13584   The villain is o'erraught of all my money.
 13585   They say this town is full of cozenage;
 13586   As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
 13587   Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
 13588   Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
 13589   Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
 13590   And many such-like liberties of sin;
 13591   If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
 13592   I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.
 13593   I greatly fear my money is not safe.

 13610 ACT Il. SCENE 1
 13611 
 13612 The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
 13613 
 13614 Enter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with LUCIANA, her sister
 13615 
 13616 ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
 13617   That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
 13618   Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
 13619 LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
 13620   And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
 13621   Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.
 13622   A man is master of his liberty;
 13623   Time is their master, and when they see time,
 13624   They'll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
 13625 ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
 13626 LUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o' door.
 13627 ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
 13628 LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.
 13629 ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
 13630 LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
 13631   There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
 13632   But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
 13633   The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
 13634   Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.
 13635   Man, more divine, the master of all these,
 13636   Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas,
 13637   Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
 13638   Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
 13639   Are masters to their females, and their lords;
 13640   Then let your will attend on their accords.
 13641 ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
 13642 LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
 13643 ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
 13644 LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
 13645 ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
 13646 LUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.
 13647 ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
 13648   They can be meek that have no other cause.
 13649   A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
 13650   We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
 13651   But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,
 13652   As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
 13653   So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
 13654   With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
 13655   But if thou live to see like right bereft,
 13656   This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
 13657 LUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
 13658   Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.
 13659 
 13660 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
 13661 
 13662 ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
 13663 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two
 13664   ears can witness.
 13665 ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
 13666 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
 13667   Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
 13668 LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning?
 13669 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to
 13670   well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could
 13671   scarce understand them.
 13672 ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
 13673   It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
 13674 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
 13675 ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
 13676 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;
 13677   But, sure, he is stark mad.
 13678   When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
 13679   He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
 13680   "Tis dinner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
 13681   'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
 13682   'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
 13683   'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
 13684   'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
 13685   'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;
 13686   I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'
 13687 LUCIANA. Quoth who?
 13688 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.
 13689   'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
 13690   So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
 13691   I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
 13692   For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
 13693 ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
 13694 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home?
 13695   For God's sake, send some other messenger.
 13696 ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
 13697 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating;
 13698   Between you I shall have a holy head.
 13699 ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
 13700 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me,
 13701   That like a football you do spurn me thus?
 13702   You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;
 13703   If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
 13704 <Exit
 13705 LUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
 13706 ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
 13707   Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
 13708   Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
 13709   From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.
 13710   Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
 13711   If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
 13712   Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
 13713   Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
 13714   That's not my fault; he's master of my state.
 13715   What ruins are in me that can be found
 13716   By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
 13717   Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
 13718   A sunny look of his would soon repair.
 13719   But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
 13720   And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
 13721 LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
 13722 ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
 13723   I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
 13724   Or else what lets it but he would be here?
 13725   Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;
 13726   Would that alone a love he would detain,
 13727   So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
 13728   I see the jewel best enamelled
 13729   Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
 13730   That others touch and, often touching, will
 13731   Where gold; and no man that hath a name
 13732   By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
 13733   Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
 13734   I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
 13735 LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
 13736 <Exeunt
 13737 
 13738 
 13739 SCENE 2
 13740 
 13741 The mart
 13742 
 13743 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
 13744 
 13745 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
 13746   Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
 13747   Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
 13748   By computation and mine host's report
 13749   I could not speak with Dromio since at first
 13750   I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
 13751 
 13752 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
 13753 
 13754   How now, sir, is your merry humour alter'd?
 13755   As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
 13756   You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
 13757   Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
 13758   My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
 13759   That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
 13760 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
 13761 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
 13762 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence,
 13763   Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
 13764 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
 13765   And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
 13766   For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
 13767 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
 13768   What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
 13769 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
 13770   Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
 13771 [Beating him]
 13772 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest.
 13773   Upon what bargain do you give it me?
 13774 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
 13775   Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
 13776   Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
 13777   And make a common of my serious hours.
 13778   When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
 13779   But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
 13780   If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
 13781   And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
 13782   Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
 13783 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you would
 13784   leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use
 13785   these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and
 13786   insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
 13787   But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?
 13788 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
 13789 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
 13790 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
 13791 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say
 13792   every why hath a wherefore.
 13793 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
 13794   For urging it the second time to me.
 13795 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
 13796   When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
 13797   Well, sir, I thank you.
 13798 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
 13799 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave
 13800   me for nothing.
 13801 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
 13802   give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
 13803 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
 13804 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
 13805 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.
 13806 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
 13807 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
 13808 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
 13809 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
 13810   another dry basting.
 13811 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
 13812   there's a time for all things.
 13813 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you
 13814   were so choleric.
 13815 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
 13816 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the
 13817   plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
 13818 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
 13819 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover
 13820   his hair that grows bald by nature.
 13821 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
 13822 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and
 13823   recover the lost hair of another man.
 13824 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
 13825   hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
 13826 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows
 13827   on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
 13828   given them in wit.
 13829 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
 13830   hath more hair than wit.
 13831 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the
 13832   wit to lose his hair.
 13833 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
 13834   men plain dealers without wit.
 13835 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;
 13836   yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
 13837 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
 13838 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.
 13839 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
 13840 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.
 13841 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
 13842 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.
 13843 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
 13844 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in
 13845   tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his
 13846   porridge.
 13847 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
 13848   is no time for all things.
 13849 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
 13850   hair lost by nature.
 13851 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
 13852   there is no time to recover.
 13853 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
 13854   and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
 13855 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
 13856   soft, who wafts us yonder?
 13857 
 13858 Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
 13859 
 13860 ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
 13861   Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
 13862   I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
 13863   The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
 13864   That never words were music to thine ear,
 13865   That never object pleasing in thine eye,
 13866   That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
 13867   That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
 13868   Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
 13869   How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
 13870   That thou art then estranged from thyself?
 13871   Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
 13872   That, undividable, incorporate,
 13873   Am better than thy dear self's better part.
 13874   Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
 13875   For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
 13876   A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
 13877   And take unmingled thence that drop again
 13878   Without addition or diminishing,
 13879   As take from me thyself, and not me too.
 13880   How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
 13881   Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
 13882   And that this body, consecrate to thee,
 13883   By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
 13884   Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
 13885   And hurl the name of husband in my face,
 13886   And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
 13887   And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
 13888   And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
 13889   I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
 13890   I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
 13891   My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
 13892   For if we two be one, and thou play false,
 13893   I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
 13894   Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
 13895   Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
 13896   I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.
 13897 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
 13898   In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
 13899   As strange unto your town as to your talk,
 13900   Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
 13901   Wants wit in all one word to understand.
 13902 LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you!
 13903   When were you wont to use my sister thus?
 13904   She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
 13905 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
 13906 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?
 13907 ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
 13908   That he did buffet thee, and in his blows
 13909   Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
 13910 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
 13911   What is the course and drift of your compact?
 13912 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her till this time.
 13913 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
 13914   Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
 13915 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.
 13916 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
 13917   Unless it be by inspiration?
 13918 ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
 13919   To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
 13920   Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
 13921   Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
 13922   But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
 13923   Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
 13924   Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
 13925   Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
 13926   Makes me with thy strength to communicate.
 13927   If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
 13928   Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
 13929   Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
 13930   Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.
 13931 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
 13932   What, was I married to her in my dream?
 13933   Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
 13934   What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
 13935   Until I know this sure uncertainty,
 13936   I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
 13937 LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
 13938 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.
 13939   This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!
 13940   We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
 13941   If we obey them not, this will ensue:
 13942   They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
 13943 LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and answer'st not?
 13944   Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
 13945 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?
 13946 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
 13947 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
 13948 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
 13949 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.
 13950 LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.
 13951 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.
 13952   'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
 13953   But I should know her as well as she knows me.
 13954 ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
 13955   To put the finger in the eye and weep,
 13956   Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
 13957   Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
 13958   Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,
 13959   And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
 13960   Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
 13961   Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
 13962   Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
 13963 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
 13964   Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?
 13965   Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd!
 13966   I'll say as they say, and persever so,
 13967   And in this mist at all adventures go.
 13968 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
 13969 ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
 13970 LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

 13987 ACT III. SCENE 1
 13988 
 13989 Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
 13990 
 13991 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR
 13992 
 13993 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
 13994   My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
 13995   Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
 13996   To see the making of her carcanet,
 13997   And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
 13998   But here's a villain that would face me down
 13999   He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
 14000   And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
 14001   And that I did deny my wife and house.
 14002   Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
 14003 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
 14004   That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;
 14005   If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
 14006   Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
 14007 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
 14008 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appear
 14009   By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
 14010   I should kick, being kick'd; and being at that pass,
 14011   You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
 14012 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
 14013   May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
 14014 BALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
 14015 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
 14016   A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
 14017 BALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
 14018 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
 14019   but words.
 14020 BALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
 14021 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
 14022   But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
 14023   Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
 14024   But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.
 14025 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
 14026 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!
 14027   Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
 14028   Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
 14029   When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.
 14030 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter?
 14031   My master stays in the street.
 14032 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,
 14033     lest he catch cold on's feet.
 14034 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
 14035 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when,
 14036     an you'll tell me wherefore.
 14037 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
 14038     I have not din'd to-day.
 14039 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must not;
 14040     come again when you may.
 14041 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
 14042     from the house I owe?
 14043 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  The porter for this time,
 14044     sir, and my name is Dromio.
 14045 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine
 14046     office and my name!
 14047   The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
 14048   If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
 14049   Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.
 14050 
 14051 Enter LUCE, within
 14052 
 14053 LUCE.  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?
 14054 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.
 14055 LUCE.  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;
 14056   And so tell your master.
 14057 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!
 14058   Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?
 14059 LUCE.  [Within]  Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tell?
 14060 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce
 14061     -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
 14062 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
 14063 LUCE.  [Within]  I thought to have ask'd you.
 14064 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  And you said no.
 14065 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
 14066 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
 14067 LUCE.  [Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
 14068 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard.
 14069 LUCE.  [Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
 14070 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
 14071 LUCE.  [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
 14072 
 14073 Enter ADRIANA, within
 14074 
 14075 ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
 14076 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  By my troth, your town is
 14077     troubled with unruly boys.
 14078 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
 14079     have come before.
 14080 ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
 14081 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
 14082 ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
 14083 BALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
 14084 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
 14085 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
 14086 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
 14087   Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold;
 14088   It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
 14089 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
 14090 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Break any breaking here,
 14091     and I'll break your knave's pate.
 14092 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,
 14093     sir; and words are but wind;
 14094   Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
 14095 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking;
 14096     out upon thee, hind!
 14097 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's too much 'out upon thee!' pray thee let me in.
 14098 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Ay, when fowls have no
 14099     feathers and fish have no fin.
 14100 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
 14101 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
 14102   For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
 14103   If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
 14104 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
 14105 BALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
 14106   Herein you war against your reputation,
 14107   And draw within the compass of suspect
 14108   Th' unviolated honour of your wife.
 14109   Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,
 14110   Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
 14111   Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
 14112   And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
 14113   Why at this time the doors are made against you.
 14114   Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
 14115   And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
 14116   And, about evening, come yourself alone
 14117   To know the reason of this strange restraint.
 14118   If by strong hand you offer to break in
 14119   Now in the stirring passage of the day,
 14120   A vulgar comment will be made of it,
 14121   And that supposed by the common rout
 14122   Against your yet ungalled estimation
 14123   That may with foul intrusion enter in
 14124   And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
 14125   For slander lives upon succession,
 14126   For ever hous'd where it gets possession.
 14127 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
 14128   And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
 14129   I know a wench of excellent discourse,
 14130   Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;
 14131   There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
 14132   My wife-but, I protest, without desert-
 14133   Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;
 14134   To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
 14135   And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
 14136   Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
 14137   For there's the house. That chain will I bestow-
 14138   Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-
 14139   Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.
 14140   Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
 14141   I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
 14142 ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
 14143 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
 14144 <Exeunt
 14145 
 14146 
 14147 SCENE 2
 14148 
 14149 Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
 14150 
 14151 Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
 14152 
 14153 LUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot
 14154   A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
 14155   Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
 14156   Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
 14157   If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
 14158   Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;
 14159   Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
 14160   Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
 14161   Let not my sister read it in your eye;
 14162   Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
 14163   Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
 14164   Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
 14165   Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
 14166   Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
 14167   Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
 14168   What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
 14169   'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
 14170   And let her read it in thy looks at board;
 14171   Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
 14172   Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.
 14173   Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
 14174   Being compact of credit, that you love us;
 14175   Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
 14176   We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
 14177   Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
 14178   Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.
 14179   'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
 14180   When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
 14181 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
 14182   Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-
 14183   Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
 14184   Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.
 14185   Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
 14186   Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
 14187   Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
 14188   The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
 14189   Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
 14190   To make it wander in an unknown field?
 14191   Are you a god? Would you create me new?
 14192   Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.
 14193   But if that I am I, then well I know
 14194   Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
 14195   Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;
 14196   Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
 14197   O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
 14198   To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
 14199   Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
 14200   Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
 14201   And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
 14202   And in that glorious supposition think
 14203   He gains by death that hath such means to die.
 14204   Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.
 14205 LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
 14206 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
 14207 LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
 14208 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
 14209 LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
 14210 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
 14211 LUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my sister so.
 14212 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
 14213 LUCIANA. That's my sister.
 14214 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
 14215   It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
 14216   Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
 14217   My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
 14218   My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
 14219 LUCIANA. All this my sister is, or else should be.
 14220 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
 14221   Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
 14222   Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
 14223   Give me thy hand.
 14224 LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you still;
 14225   I'll fetch my sister to get her good will.
 14226 <Exit LUCIANA
 14227 
 14228 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 14229 
 14230 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
 14231   so fast?
 14232 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?
 14233   Am I your man? Am I myself?
 14234 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
 14235   man, thou art thyself.
 14236 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and besides
 14237   myself.
 14238 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
 14239 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due
 14240   to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one
 14241   that will have me.
 14242 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
 14243 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such claim as you would
 14244   lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not
 14245   that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
 14246   being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
 14247 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
 14248 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one
 14249   as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'
 14250   I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
 14251   wondrous fat marriage.
 14252 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
 14253 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench,
 14254   and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but
 14255   to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
 14256   I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
 14257   Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn
 14258   week longer than the whole world.
 14259 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
 14260 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face
 14261   nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may
 14262   go over shoes in the grime of it.
 14263 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
 14264 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood
 14265   could not do it.
 14266 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
 14267 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three
 14268   quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure
 14269   her from hip to hip.
 14270 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
 14271 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to foot than
 14272   from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find
 14273   out countries in her.
 14274 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
 14275 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by
 14276   the bogs.
 14277 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
 14278 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the barrenness, hard in
 14279   the palm of the hand.
 14280 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
 14281 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
 14282   making war against her heir.
 14283 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
 14284 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
 14285   could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her
 14286   chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
 14287 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
 14288 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
 14289   her breath.
 14290 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
 14291 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
 14292   rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the
 14293   hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
 14294   ballast at her nose.
 14295 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
 14296 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To
 14297   conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call'd me
 14298   Dromio; swore I was assur'd to her; told me what privy
 14299   marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the
 14300   mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,
 14301   amaz'd, ran from her as a witch.
 14302   And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,
 14303     and my heart of steel,
 14304   She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.
 14305 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
 14306   An if the wind blow any way from shore,
 14307   I will not harbour in this town to-night.
 14308   If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
 14309   Where I will walk till thou return to me.
 14310   If every one knows us, and we know none,
 14311   'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
 14312 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life,
 14313   So fly I from her that would be my wife.
 14314 <Exit
 14315 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
 14316   And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
 14317   She that doth call me husband, even my soul
 14318   Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
 14319   Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
 14320   Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
 14321   Hath almost made me traitor to myself;
 14322   But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
 14323   I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
 14324 
 14325 Enter ANGELO with the chain
 14326 
 14327 ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
 14328 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
 14329 ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
 14330   I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
 14331   The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
 14332 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
 14333 ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
 14334 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
 14335 ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
 14336   Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
 14337   And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
 14338   And then receive my money for the chain.
 14339 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
 14340   For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
 14341 ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
 14342 <Exit
 14343 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
 14344   But this I think, there's no man is so vain
 14345   That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
 14346   I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
 14347   When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
 14348   I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
 14349   If any ship put out, then straight away.

 14366 ACT IV. SCENE 1
 14367 
 14368 A public place
 14369 
 14370 Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER
 14371 
 14372 SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
 14373   And since I have not much importun'd you;
 14374   Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
 14375   To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
 14376   Therefore make present satisfaction,
 14377   Or I'll attach you by this officer.
 14378 ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
 14379   Is growing to me by Antipholus;
 14380   And in the instant that I met with you
 14381   He had of me a chain; at five o'clock
 14382   I shall receive the money for the same.
 14383   Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
 14384   I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.
 14385 
 14386 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'S
 14387 
 14388 OFFICER. That labour may you save; see where he comes.
 14389 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
 14390   And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
 14391   Among my wife and her confederates,
 14392   For locking me out of my doors by day.
 14393   But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
 14394   Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
 14395 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope.
 14396 <Exit DROMIO
 14397 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
 14398   I promised your presence and the chain;
 14399   But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
 14400   Belike you thought our love would last too long,
 14401   If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
 14402 ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
 14403   How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
 14404   The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
 14405   Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
 14406   Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
 14407   I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
 14408   For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
 14409 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
 14410   Besides, I have some business in the town.
 14411   Good signior, take the stranger to my house,
 14412   And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
 14413   Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
 14414   Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
 14415 ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
 14416 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
 14417 ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
 14418 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
 14419   Or else you may return without your money.
 14420 ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
 14421   Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
 14422   And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
 14423 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
 14424   Your breach of promise to the Porpentine;
 14425   I should have chid you for not bringing it,
 14426   But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
 14427 SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
 14428 ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
 14429 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
 14430 ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
 14431   Either send the chain or send by me some token.
 14432 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
 14433   Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it.
 14434 SECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.
 14435   Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;
 14436   If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
 14437 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
 14438 ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
 14439 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
 14440 ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
 14441 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
 14442 ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
 14443   Consider how it stands upon my credit.
 14444 SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
 14445 OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
 14446 ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
 14447   Either consent to pay this sum for me,
 14448   Or I attach you by this officer.
 14449 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
 14450   Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.
 14451 ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
 14452   I would not spare my brother in this case,
 14453   If he should scorn me so apparently.
 14454 OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
 14455 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
 14456   But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
 14457   As all the metal in your shop will answer.
 14458 ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
 14459   To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
 14460 
 14461 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay
 14462 
 14463 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum
 14464   That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
 14465   And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
 14466   I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
 14467   The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.
 14468   The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
 14469   Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an
 14470   But for their owner, master, and yourself.
 14471 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
 14472   What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
 14473 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
 14474 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
 14475   And told thee to what purpose and what end.
 14476 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as soon-
 14477   You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
 14478 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
 14479   And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
 14480   To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
 14481   Give her this key, and tell her in the desk
 14482   That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
 14483   There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.
 14484   Tell her I am arrested in the street,
 14485   And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.
 14486   On, officer, to prison till it come.
 14487 <Exeunt all but DROMIO
 14488 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
 14489   Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.
 14490   She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
 14491   Thither I must, although against my will,
 14492   For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

 14497 
 14498 The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
 14499 
 14500 Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
 14501 
 14502 ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
 14503   Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye
 14504   That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?
 14505   Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
 14506   What observation mad'st thou in this case
 14507   Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
 14508 LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.
 14509 ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
 14510 LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
 14511 ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
 14512 LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.
 14513 ADRIANA. And what said he?
 14514 LUCIANA. That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
 14515 ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
 14516 LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move.
 14517   First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
 14518 ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
 14519 LUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.
 14520 ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
 14521   My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
 14522   He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
 14523   Ill-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
 14524   Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
 14525   Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
 14526 LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one?
 14527   No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
 14528 ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
 14529   And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
 14530   Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
 14531   My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
 14532 
 14533 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 14534 
 14535 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet
 14536   now, make haste.
 14537 LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?
 14538 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.
 14539 ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
 14540 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
 14541   A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
 14542   One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
 14543   A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
 14544   A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
 14545   A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
 14546   The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
 14547   A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
 14548   One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.
 14549 ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
 14550 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the case.
 14551 ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
 14552 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
 14553   But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
 14554   Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
 14555 ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
 14556   Thus he unknown to me should be in debt.
 14557   Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
 14558 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing,
 14559   A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
 14560 ADRIANA. What, the chain?
 14561 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone.
 14562   It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
 14563 ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
 14564 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant,
 14565     'a turns back for very fear.
 14566 ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
 14567 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes
 14568     more than he's worth to season.
 14569   Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
 14570   That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
 14571   If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
 14572   Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
 14573 
 14574 Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
 14575 
 14576 ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
 14577   And bring thy master home immediately.
 14578   Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceit-
 14579   Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

 14586 
 14587 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
 14588 
 14589 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
 14590   As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
 14591   And every one doth call me by my name.
 14592   Some tender money to me, some invite me,
 14593   Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,
 14594   Some offer me commodities to buy;
 14595   Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,
 14596   And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
 14597   And therewithal took measure of my body.
 14598   Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,
 14599   And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
 14600 
 14601 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
 14602 
 14603 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me
 14604   for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd?
 14605 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
 14606 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,
 14607   but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the
 14608   calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind
 14609   you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
 14610 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
 14611 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that
 14612   went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
 14613   that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest
 14614   them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give
 14615   them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
 14616   exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
 14617 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
 14618 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;
 14619   that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on
 14620   that thinks a man always going to bed, and says 'God give
 14621   you good rest!'
 14622 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
 14623   there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?
 14624 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an
 14625   hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and
 14626   then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the
 14627   boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.
 14628 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
 14629   And here we wander in illusions.
 14630   Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
 14631 
 14632 Enter a COURTEZAN
 14633 
 14634 COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
 14635   I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
 14636   Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
 14637 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
 14638 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?
 14639 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
 14640 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's
 14641   dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and
 14642   thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's
 14643   as much to say 'God make me a light wench!' It is written
 14644   they appear to men like angels of light; light is an effect
 14645   of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn.
 14646   Come not near her.
 14647 COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
 14648   Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.
 14649 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,
 14650   or bespeak a long spoon.
 14651 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
 14652 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon
 14653   that must eat with the devil.
 14654 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
 14655   Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;
 14656   I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
 14657 COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
 14658   Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,
 14659   And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
 14660 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
 14661   A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
 14662   A nut, a cherry-stone;
 14663   But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
 14664   Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
 14665   The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.
 14666 COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;
 14667   I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
 14668 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
 14669 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know.
 14670 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
 14671 COURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
 14672   Else would he never so demean himself.
 14673   A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
 14674   And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
 14675   Both one and other he denies me now.
 14676   The reason that I gather he is mad,
 14677   Besides this present instance of his rage,
 14678   Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
 14679   Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
 14680   Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
 14681   On purpose shut the doors against his way.
 14682   My way is now to hie home to his house,
 14683   And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
 14684   He rush'd into my house and took perforce
 14685   My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
 14686   For forty ducats is too much to lose.
 14687 <Exit
 14688 
 14689 
 14690 SCENE 4
 14691 
 14692 A street
 14693 
 14694 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER
 14695 
 14696 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
 14697   I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
 14698   To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
 14699   My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
 14700   And will not lightly trust the messenger.
 14701   That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
 14702   I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her cars.
 14703 
 14704 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end
 14705 
 14706   Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
 14707   How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?
 14708 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
 14709 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
 14710 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
 14711 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
 14712 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
 14713 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
 14714 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I
 14715   return'd.
 14716 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
 14717 [Beating him]
 14718 OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.
 14719 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in
 14720   adversity.
 14721 OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.
 14722 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
 14723 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
 14724 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I
 14725   might not feel your blows.
 14726 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
 14727   blows, and so is an ass.
 14728 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it
 14729   by my long 'ears. I have served him from the hour of my
 14730   nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for
 14731   my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with
 14732   beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am
 14733   wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
 14734   out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
 14735   with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as
 14736   beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me,
 14737   I shall beg with it from door to door.
 14738 
 14739 Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER
 14740 call'd PINCH
 14741 
 14742 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
 14743 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
 14744   rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.'
 14745 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
 14746 [Beating him]
 14747 COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
 14748 ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
 14749   Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:
 14750   Establish him in his true sense again,
 14751   And I will please you what you will demand.
 14752 LUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
 14753 COURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
 14754 PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
 14755 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
 14756 [Striking him]
 14757 PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,
 14758   To yield possession to my holy prayers,
 14759   And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
 14760   I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
 14761 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
 14762 ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
 14763 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
 14764   Did this companion with the saffron face
 14765   Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
 14766   Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,
 14767   And I denied to enter in my house?
 14768 ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
 14769   Where would you had remain'd until this time,
 14770   Free from these slanders and this open shame!
 14771 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
 14772 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
 14773 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
 14774 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
 14775 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
 14776 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there.
 14777 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
 14778 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
 14779 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
 14780 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness,
 14781   That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
 14782 ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
 14783 PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
 14784   And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
 14785 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
 14786 ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
 14787   By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
 14788 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might,
 14789   But surely, master, not a rag of money.
 14790 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
 14791 ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
 14792 LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.
 14793 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness
 14794   That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
 14795 PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
 14796   I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
 14797   They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.
 14798 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
 14799   And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
 14800 ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
 14801 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;
 14802   But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
 14803 ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
 14804 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
 14805   And art confederate with a damned pack
 14806   To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
 14807   But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
 14808   That would behold in me this shameful sport.
 14809 ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
 14810 PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.
 14811 
 14812 Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives
 14813 
 14814 LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
 14815 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
 14816   I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them
 14817   To make a rescue?
 14818 OFFICER. Masters, let him go;
 14819   He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
 14820 PINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
 14821 [They bind DROMIO]
 14822 ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
 14823   Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
 14824   Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
 14825 OFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
 14826   The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
 14827 ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
 14828   Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
 14829   And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
 14830   Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey'd
 14831   Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
 14832 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
 14833 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.
 14834 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
 14835   dost thou mad me?
 14836 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing?
 14837   Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
 14838 LUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
 14839 ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
 14840 <Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN
 14841   Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
 14842 OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
 14843 ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
 14844 OFFICER. Two hundred ducats.
 14845 ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
 14846 OFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.
 14847 ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
 14848 COURTEZAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day
 14849   Came to my house, and took away my ring-
 14850   The ring I saw upon his finger now-
 14851   Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
 14852 ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
 14853   Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;
 14854   I long to know the truth hereof at large.
 14855 
 14856 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, with his rapier drawn, and
 14857 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
 14858 
 14859 LUCIANA. God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
 14860 ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.
 14861   Let's call more help to have them bound again.
 14862 OFFICER. Away, they'll kill us!
 14863 <Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and
 14864 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE as fast as may be, frighted
 14865 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
 14866 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. She that would be your wife now ran from you.
 14867 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
 14868   I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
 14869 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night; they will
 14870   surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us
 14871   gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
 14872   the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me,
 14873   could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.
 14874 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
 14875   Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
 14876 <Exeunt

 14892 ACT V. SCENE 1
 14893 
 14894 A street before a priory
 14895 
 14896 Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO
 14897 
 14898 ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
 14899   But I protest he had the chain of me,
 14900   Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
 14901 SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
 14902 ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
 14903   Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,
 14904   Second to none that lives here in the city;
 14905   His word might bear my wealth at any time.
 14906 SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
 14907 
 14908 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
 14909 
 14910 ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
 14911   Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
 14912   Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
 14913   Signior Andpholus, I wonder much
 14914   That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
 14915   And, not without some scandal to yourself,
 14916   With circumstance and oaths so to deny
 14917   This chain, which now you wear so openly.
 14918   Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
 14919   You have done wrong to this my honest friend;
 14920   Who, but for staying on our controversy,
 14921   Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.
 14922   This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
 14923 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
 14924 SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
 14925 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
 14926 SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
 14927   Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
 14928   To walk where any honest men resort.
 14929 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
 14930   I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
 14931   Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.
 14932 SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
 14933 [They draw]
 14934 
 14935 Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS
 14936 
 14937 ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
 14938   Some get within him, take his sword away;
 14939   Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
 14940 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a house.
 14941   This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.
 14942 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory
 14943 
 14944 Enter the LADY ABBESS
 14945 
 14946 ABBESS. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
 14947 ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
 14948   Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
 14949   And bear him home for his recovery.
 14950 ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
 14951 SECOND MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
 14952 ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?
 14953 ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
 14954   And much different from the man he was;
 14955   But till this afternoon his passion
 14956   Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
 14957 ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
 14958   Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
 14959   Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
 14960   A sin prevailing much in youthful men
 14961   Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
 14962   Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
 14963 ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
 14964   Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
 14965 ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.
 14966 ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
 14967 ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.
 14968 ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
 14969 ABBESS. Haply in private.
 14970 ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
 14971 ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.
 14972 ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
 14973   In bed, he slept not for my urging it;
 14974   At board, he fed not for my urging it;
 14975   Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
 14976   In company, I often glanced it;
 14977   Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
 14978 ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad.
 14979   The venom clamours of a jealous woman
 14980   Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
 14981   It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
 14982   And thereof comes it that his head is light.
 14983   Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
 14984   Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
 14985   Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
 14986   And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
 14987   Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
 14988   Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
 14989   But moody and dull melancholy,
 14990   Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
 14991   And at her heels a huge infectious troop
 14992   Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
 14993   In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
 14994   To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
 14995   The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits
 14996   Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
 14997 LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,
 14998   When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
 14999   Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?
 15000 ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
 15001   Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.
 15002 ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.
 15003 ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
 15004 ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,
 15005   And it shall privilege him from your hands
 15006   Till I have brought him to his wits again,
 15007   Or lose my labour in assaying it.
 15008 ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
 15009   Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
 15010   And will have no attorney but myself;
 15011   And therefore let me have him home with me.
 15012 ABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir
 15013   Till I have us'd the approved means I have,
 15014   With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
 15015   To make of him a formal man again.
 15016   It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
 15017   A charitable duty of my order;
 15018   Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.
 15019 ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
 15020   And ill it doth beseem your holiness
 15021   To separate the husband and the wife.
 15022 ABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.
 15023 <Exit
 15024 LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
 15025 ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
 15026   And never rise until my tears and prayers
 15027   Have won his Grace to come in person hither
 15028   And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
 15029 SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;
 15030   Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
 15031   Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
 15032   The place of death and sorry execution,
 15033   Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
 15034 ANGELO. Upon what cause?
 15035 SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
 15036   Who put unluckily into this bay
 15037   Against the laws and statutes of this town,
 15038   Beheaded publicly for his offence.
 15039 ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
 15040 LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.
 15041 
 15042 Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded;
 15043 with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS
 15044 
 15045 DUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
 15046   If any friend will pay the sum for him,
 15047   He shall not die; so much we tender him.
 15048 ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
 15049 DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;
 15050   It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
 15051 ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
 15052   Who I made lord of me and all I had
 15053   At your important letters-this ill day
 15054   A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
 15055   That desp'rately he hurried through the street,
 15056   With him his bondman all as mad as he,
 15057   Doing displeasure to the citizens
 15058   By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
 15059   Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
 15060   Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
 15061   Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
 15062   That here and there his fury had committed.
 15063   Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
 15064   He broke from those that had the guard of him,
 15065   And with his mad attendant and himself,
 15066   Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
 15067   Met us again and, madly bent on us,
 15068   Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,
 15069   We came again to bind them. Then they fled
 15070   Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
 15071   And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
 15072   And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
 15073   Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
 15074   Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
 15075   Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
 15076 DUKE. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,
 15077   And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
 15078   When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
 15079   To do him all the grace and good I could.
 15080   Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,
 15081   And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
 15082   I will determine this before I stir.
 15083 
 15084 Enter a MESSENGER
 15085 
 15086 MESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
 15087   My master and his man are both broke loose,
 15088   Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,
 15089   Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;
 15090   And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
 15091   Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
 15092   My master preaches patience to him, and the while
 15093   His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
 15094   And sure, unless you send some present help,
 15095   Between them they will kill the conjurer.
 15096 ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
 15097   And that is false thou dost report to us.
 15098 MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
 15099   I have not breath'd almost since I did see it.
 15100   He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
 15101   To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
 15102 [Cry within]
 15103   Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!
 15104 DUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds.
 15105 ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
 15106   That he is borne about invisible.
 15107   Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
 15108   And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
 15109 
 15110 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS
 15111 
 15112 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
 15113   Even for the service that long since I did thee,
 15114   When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
 15115   Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
 15116   That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
 15117 AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
 15118   I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
 15119 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
 15120   She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
 15121   That hath abused and dishonoured me
 15122   Even in the strength and height of injury.
 15123   Beyond imagination is the wrong
 15124   That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
 15125 DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
 15126 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
 15127   While she with harlots feasted in my house.
 15128 DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?
 15129 ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
 15130   To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
 15131   As this is false he burdens me withal!
 15132 LUCIANA. Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
 15133   But she tells to your Highness simple truth!
 15134 ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
 15135   In this the madman justly chargeth them.
 15136 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
 15137   Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
 15138   Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
 15139   Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
 15140   This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;
 15141   That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
 15142   Could witness it, for he was with me then;
 15143   Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
 15144   Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
 15145   Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
 15146   Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
 15147   I went to seek him. In the street I met him,
 15148   And in his company that gentleman.
 15149   There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
 15150   That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
 15151   Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
 15152   He did arrest me with an officer.
 15153   I did obey, and sent my peasant home
 15154   For certain ducats; he with none return'd.
 15155   Then fairly I bespoke the officer
 15156   To go in person with me to my house.
 15157   By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
 15158   Of vile confederates. Along with them
 15159   They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
 15160   A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
 15161   A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
 15162   A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
 15163   A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
 15164   Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
 15165   And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
 15166   And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
 15167   Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together
 15168   They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
 15169   And in a dark and dankish vault at home
 15170   There left me and my man, both bound together;
 15171   Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
 15172   I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
 15173   Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
 15174   To give me ample satisfaction
 15175   For these deep shames and great indignities.
 15176 ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
 15177   That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
 15178 DUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
 15179 ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
 15180   These people saw the chain about his neck.
 15181 SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
 15182   Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
 15183   After you first forswore it on the mart;
 15184   And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
 15185   And then you fled into this abbey here,
 15186   From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
 15187 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
 15188   Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
 15189   I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
 15190   And this is false you burden me withal.
 15191 DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
 15192   I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
 15193   If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
 15194   If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
 15195   You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here
 15196   Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
 15197 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine.
 15198 COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
 15199 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
 15200 DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
 15201 COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
 15202 DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.
 15203   I think you are all mated or stark mad.
 15204 <Exit one to the ABBESS
 15205 AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
 15206   Haply I see a friend will save my life
 15207   And pay the sum that may deliver me.
 15208 DUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
 15209 AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
 15210   And is not that your bondman Dromio?
 15211 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
 15212   But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords
 15213   Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
 15214 AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.
 15215 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
 15216   For lately we were bound as you are now.
 15217   You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
 15218 AEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.
 15219 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
 15220 AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;
 15221   And careful hours with time's deformed hand
 15222   Have written strange defeatures in my face.
 15223   But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
 15224 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
 15225 AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?
 15226 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.
 15227 AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.
 15228 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and
 15229   whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
 15230 AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
 15231   Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
 15232   In seven short years that here my only son
 15233   Knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares?
 15234   Though now this grained face of mine be hid
 15235   In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
 15236   And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
 15237   Yet hath my night of life some memory,
 15238   My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
 15239   My dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
 15240   All these old witnesses-I cannot err-
 15241   Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
 15242 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
 15243 AEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,
 15244   Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,
 15245   Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery.
 15246 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
 15247   the city Can witness with me that it is not so:
 15248   I ne'er saw Syracuse in my life.
 15249 DUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
 15250   Have I been patron to Antipholus,
 15251   During which time he ne'er saw Syracuse.
 15252   I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
 15253 
 15254 Re-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
 15255 
 15256 ABBESS. Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
 15257 [All gather to see them]
 15258 ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
 15259 DUKE. One of these men is genius to the other;
 15260   And so of these. Which is the natural man,
 15261   And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
 15262 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
 15263 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, Sir, am Dromio; pray let me stay.
 15264 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
 15265 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master! who hath bound
 15266 ABBESS. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
 15267   And gain a husband by his liberty.
 15268   Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man
 15269   That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,
 15270   That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
 15271   O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
 15272   And speak unto the same Aemilia!
 15273 AEGEON. If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.
 15274   If thou art she, tell me where is that son
 15275   That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
 15276 ABBESS. By men of Epidamnum he and I
 15277   And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
 15278   But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
 15279   By force took Dromio and my son from them,
 15280   And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
 15281   What then became of them I cannot tell;
 15282   I to this fortune that you see me in.
 15283 DUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right.
 15284   These two Antipholus', these two so like,
 15285   And these two Dromios, one in semblance-
 15286   Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-
 15287   These are the parents to these children,
 15288   Which accidentally are met together.
 15289   Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
 15290 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
 15291 DUKE. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
 15292 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
 15293 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.
 15294 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
 15295   Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
 15296 ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
 15297 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
 15298 ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?
 15299 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
 15300 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
 15301   And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
 15302   Did call me brother.  [To LUCIANA]  What I told you then,
 15303   I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
 15304   If this be not a dream I see and hear.
 15305 ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
 15306 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
 15307 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
 15308 ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
 15309 ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
 15310   By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
 15311 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.
 15312 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
 15313   And Dromio my man did bring them me.
 15314   I see we still did meet each other's man,
 15315   And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
 15316   And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.
 15317 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
 15318 DUKE. It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
 15319 COURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
 15320 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
 15321   good cheer.
 15322 ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
 15323   To go with us into the abbey here,
 15324   And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
 15325   And all that are assembled in this place
 15326   That by this sympathized one day's error
 15327   Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
 15328   And we shall make full satisfaction.
 15329   Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
 15330   Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
 15331   My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
 15332   The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
 15333   And you the calendars of their nativity,
 15334   Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
 15335   After so long grief, such nativity!
 15336 DUKE. With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
 15337 <Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF
 15338 EPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS
 15339 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
 15340 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
 15341 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
 15342 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
 15343   Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.
 15344   Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
 15345 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
 15346 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master's house,
 15347   That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner;
 15348   She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
 15349 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother;
 15350   I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth.
 15351   Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
 15352 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir; you are my elder.
 15353 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. That's a question; how shall we try it?
 15354 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then,
 15355     lead thou first.
 15356 DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus:
 15357   We came into the world like brother and brother,
 15358   And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
 15359 <Exeunt
 15360

 15433 SCENE:
 15434 Rome and the neighbourhood; Corioli and the neighbourhood; Antium
 15435 
 15436 
 15437 
 15438 ACT I. SCENE I.
 15439 Rome. A street
 15440 
 15441 Enter a company of mutinous citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons
 15442 
 15443   FIRST CITIZEN. Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
 15444   ALL. Speak, speak.
 15445   FIRST CITIZEN. YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?
 15446   ALL. Resolv'd, resolv'd.
 15447   FIRST CITIZEN. First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
 15448     people.
 15449   ALL. We know't, we know't.
 15450   FIRST CITIZEN. Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own
 15451     price. Is't a verdict?
 15452   ALL. No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!
 15453   SECOND CITIZEN. One word, good citizens.
 15454   FIRST CITIZEN. We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
 15455     What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield
 15456     us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess
 15457     they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The
 15458     leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
 15459     inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a
 15460     gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
 15461     rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
 15462     thirst for revenge.
 15463   SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
 15464   FIRST CITIZEN. Against him first; he's a very dog to the
 15465     commonalty.
 15466   SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his
 15467     country?
 15468   FIRST CITIZEN. Very well, and could be content to give him good
 15469     report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.
 15470   SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, but speak not maliciously.
 15471   FIRST CITIZEN. I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it
 15472     to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it
 15473     was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be
 15474     partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
 15475   SECOND CITIZEN. What he cannot help in his nature you account a
 15476     vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
 15477   FIRST CITIZEN. If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
 15478     he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts
 15479     within]  What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is
 15480     risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!
 15481   ALL. Come, come.
 15482   FIRST CITIZEN. Soft! who comes here?
 15483 
 15484                        Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
 15485 
 15486   SECOND CITIZEN. Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd
 15487     the people.
 15488   FIRST CITIZEN. He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!
 15489   MENENIUS. What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
 15490     With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.
 15491   FIRST CITIZEN. Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have
 15492     had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll
 15493     show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;
 15494     they shall know we have strong arms too.
 15495   MENENIUS. Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
 15496     Will you undo yourselves?
 15497   FIRST CITIZEN. We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
 15498   MENENIUS. I tell you, friends, most charitable care
 15499     Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
 15500     Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
 15501     Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
 15502     Against the Roman state; whose course will on
 15503     The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
 15504     Of more strong link asunder than can ever
 15505     Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
 15506     The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
 15507     Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
 15508     You are transported by calamity
 15509     Thither where more attends you; and you slander
 15510     The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,
 15511     When you curse them as enemies.
 15512   FIRST CITIZEN. Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us
 15513     yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with
 15514     grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily
 15515     any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more
 15516     piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the
 15517     wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear
 15518     us.
 15519   MENENIUS. Either you must
 15520     Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
 15521     Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you
 15522     A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
 15523     But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
 15524     To stale't a little more.
 15525   FIRST CITIZEN. Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to
 15526     fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.
 15527   MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members
 15528     Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
 15529     That only like a gulf it did remain
 15530     I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,
 15531     Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
 15532     Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments
 15533     Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
 15534     And, mutually participate, did minister
 15535     Unto the appetite and affection common
 15536     Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-
 15537   FIRST CITIZEN. Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
 15538   MENENIUS. Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
 15539     Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-
 15540     For look you, I may make the belly smile
 15541     As well as speak- it tauntingly replied
 15542     To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts
 15543     That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
 15544     As you malign our senators for that
 15545     They are not such as you.
 15546   FIRST CITIZEN. Your belly's answer- What?
 15547     The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
 15548     The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
 15549     Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
 15550     With other muniments and petty helps
 15551     Is this our fabric, if that they-
 15552   MENENIUS. What then?
 15553     Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?
 15554   FIRST CITIZEN. Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
 15555     Who is the sink o' th' body-
 15556   MENENIUS. Well, what then?
 15557   FIRST CITIZEN. The former agents, if they did complain,
 15558     What could the belly answer?
 15559   MENENIUS. I will tell you;
 15560     If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-
 15561     Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.
 15562   FIRST CITIZEN. Y'are long about it.
 15563   MENENIUS. Note me this, good friend:
 15564     Your most grave belly was deliberate,
 15565     Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
 15566     'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
 15567     'That I receive the general food at first
 15568     Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
 15569     Because I am the storehouse and the shop
 15570     Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
 15571     I send it through the rivers of your blood,
 15572     Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;
 15573     And, through the cranks and offices of man,
 15574     The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
 15575     From me receive that natural competency
 15576     Whereby they live. And though that all at once
 15577     You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.
 15578   FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, sir; well, well.
 15579   MENENIUS. 'Though all at once cannot
 15580     See what I do deliver out to each,
 15581     Yet I can make my audit up, that all
 15582     From me do back receive the flour of all,
 15583     And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?
 15584   FIRST CITIZEN. It was an answer. How apply you this?
 15585   MENENIUS. The senators of Rome are this good belly,
 15586     And you the mutinous members; for, examine
 15587     Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
 15588     Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find
 15589     No public benefit which you receive
 15590     But it proceeds or comes from them to you,
 15591     And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
 15592     You, the great toe of this assembly?
 15593   FIRST CITIZEN. I the great toe? Why the great toe?
 15594   MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,
 15595     Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
 15596     Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
 15597     Lead'st first to win some vantage.
 15598     But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.
 15599     Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
 15600     The one side must have bale.
 15601 
 15602                       Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
 15603 
 15604     Hail, noble Marcius!
 15605   MARCIUS. Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues
 15606     That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
 15607     Make yourselves scabs?
 15608   FIRST CITIZEN. We have ever your good word.
 15609   MARCIUS. He that will give good words to thee will flatter
 15610     Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
 15611     That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,
 15612     The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
 15613     Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
 15614     Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
 15615     Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
 15616     Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
 15617     To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
 15618     And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
 15619     Deserves your hate; and your affections are
 15620     A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
 15621     Which would increase his evil. He that depends
 15622     Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
 15623     And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
 15624     With every minute you do change a mind
 15625     And call him noble that was now your hate,
 15626     Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter
 15627     That in these several places of the city
 15628     You cry against the noble Senate, who,
 15629     Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
 15630     Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
 15631   MENENIUS. For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
 15632     The city is well stor'd.
 15633   MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say!
 15634     They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
 15635     What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
 15636     Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out
 15637     Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,
 15638     And feebling such as stand not in their liking
 15639     Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
 15640     Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
 15641     And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
 15642     With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
 15643     As I could pick my lance.
 15644   MENENIUS. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
 15645     For though abundantly they lack discretion,
 15646     Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
 15647     What says the other troop?
 15648   MARCIUS. They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
 15649     They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
 15650     That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
 15651     That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
 15652     Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
 15653     They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
 15654     And a petition granted them- a strange one,
 15655     To break the heart of generosity
 15656     And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
 15657     As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,
 15658     Shouting their emulation.
 15659   MENENIUS. What is granted them?
 15660   MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
 15661     Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-
 15662     Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!
 15663     The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
 15664     Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
 15665     Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
 15666     For insurrection's arguing.
 15667   MENENIUS. This is strange.
 15668   MARCIUS. Go get you home, you fragments.
 15669 
 15670                      Enter a MESSENGER, hastily
 15671 
 15672   MESSENGER. Where's Caius Marcius?
 15673   MARCIUS. Here. What's the matter?
 15674   MESSENGER. The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
 15675   MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
 15676     Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
 15677 
 15678          Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with other SENATORS;
 15679                   JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
 15680 
 15681   FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:
 15682     The Volsces are in arms.
 15683   MARCIUS. They have a leader,
 15684     Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
 15685     I sin in envying his nobility;
 15686     And were I anything but what I am,
 15687     I would wish me only he.
 15688   COMINIUS. You have fought together?
 15689   MARCIUS. Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he
 15690     Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
 15691     Only my wars with him. He is a lion
 15692     That I am proud to hunt.
 15693   FIRST SENATOR. Then, worthy Marcius,
 15694     Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
 15695   COMINIUS. It is your former promise.
 15696   MARCIUS. Sir, it is;
 15697     And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
 15698     Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
 15699     What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?
 15700   LARTIUS. No, Caius Marcius;
 15701     I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
 15702     Ere stay behind this business.
 15703   MENENIUS. O, true bred!
 15704   FIRST SENATOR. Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know,
 15705     Our greatest friends attend us.
 15706   LARTIUS.  [To COMINIUS]  Lead you on.
 15707     [To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
 15708     Right worthy you priority.
 15709   COMINIUS. Noble Marcius!
 15710   FIRST SENATOR.  [To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.
 15711   MARCIUS. Nay, let them follow.
 15712     The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither
 15713     To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,
 15714     Your valour puts well forth; pray follow.
 15715          Ciitzens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
 15716   SICINIUS. Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
 15717   BRUTUS. He has no equal.
 15718   SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the people-
 15719   BRUTUS. Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
 15720   SICINIUS. Nay, but his taunts!
 15721   BRUTUS. Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.
 15722   SICINIUS. Bemock the modest moon.
 15723   BRUTUS. The present wars devour him! He is grown
 15724     Too proud to be so valiant.
 15725   SICINIUS. Such a nature,
 15726     Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
 15727     Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
 15728     His insolence can brook to be commanded
 15729     Under Cominius.
 15730   BRUTUS. Fame, at the which he aims-
 15731     In whom already he is well grac'd- cannot
 15732     Better be held nor more attain'd than by
 15733     A place below the first; for what miscarries
 15734     Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
 15735     To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
 15736     Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
 15737     Had borne the business!'
 15738   SICINIUS. Besides, if things go well,
 15739     Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
 15740     Of his demerits rob Cominius.
 15741   BRUTUS. Come.
 15742     Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
 15743     Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
 15744     To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
 15745     In aught he merit not.
 15746   SICINIUS. Let's hence and hear
 15747     How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
 15748     More than his singularity, he goes
 15749     Upon this present action.
 15750   BRUTUS. Let's along.                                    Exeunt
 15751 
 15752 
 15753 
 15754 
 15755 SCENE II.
 15756 Corioli. The Senate House.
 15757 
 15758 Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli
 15759 
 15760   FIRST SENATOR. So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
 15761     That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
 15762     And know how we proceed.
 15763   AUFIDIUS. Is it not yours?
 15764     What ever have been thought on in this state
 15765     That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
 15766     Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
 15767     Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think
 15768     I have the letter here;.yes, here it is:
 15769     [Reads]  'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
 15770     Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;
 15771     The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
 15772     Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
 15773     Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
 15774     And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
 15775     These three lead on this preparation
 15776     Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;
 15777     Consider of it.'
 15778   FIRST SENATOR. Our army's in the field;
 15779     We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
 15780     To answer us.
 15781   AUFIDIUS. Nor did you think it folly
 15782     To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
 15783     They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
 15784     It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery
 15785     We shall be short'ned in our aim, which was
 15786     To take in many towns ere almost Rome
 15787     Should know we were afoot.
 15788   SECOND SENATOR. Noble Aufidius,
 15789     Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
 15790     Let us alone to guard Corioli.
 15791     If they set down before's, for the remove
 15792     Bring up your army; but I think you'll find
 15793     Th' have not prepar'd for us.
 15794   AUFIDIUS. O, doubt not that!
 15795     I speak from certainties. Nay more,
 15796     Some parcels of their power are forth already,
 15797     And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
 15798     If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
 15799     'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
 15800     Till one can do no more.
 15801   ALL. The gods assist you!
 15802   AUFIDIUS. And keep your honours safe!
 15803   FIRST SENATOR. Farewell.
 15804   SECOND SENATOR. Farewell.
 15805   ALL. Farewell.                                           Exeunt
 15806 
 15807 
 15808 
 15809 
 15810 SCENE III.
 15811 Rome. MARCIUS' house
 15812 
 15813 Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA, mother and wife to MARCIUS;
 15814 they set them down on two low stools and sew
 15815 
 15816   VOLUMNIA. I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
 15817     comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier
 15818     rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
 15819     embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet
 15820     he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth
 15821     with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
 15822     kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her
 15823     beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person-
 15824     that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if
 15825     renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
 15826     he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
 15827     return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I
 15828     sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than
 15829     now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.
 15830   VIRGILIA. But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
 15831   VOLUMNIA. Then his good report should have been my son; I therein
 15832     would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
 15833     sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
 15834     good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
 15835     than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
 15836 
 15837                         Enter a GENTLEWOMAN
 15838 
 15839   GENTLEWOMAN. Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
 15840   VIRGILIA. Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.
 15841   VOLUMNIA. Indeed you shall not.
 15842     Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;
 15843     See him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair;
 15844     As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
 15845     Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
 15846     'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,
 15847     Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
 15848     With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
 15849     Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
 15850     Or all or lose his hire.
 15851   VIRGILIA. His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!
 15852   VOLUMNIA. Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
 15853     Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,
 15854     When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
 15855     Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
 15856     At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria
 15857     We are fit to bid her welcome.              Exit GENTLEWOMAN
 15858   VIRGILIA. Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
 15859   VOLUMNIA. He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
 15860     And tread upon his neck.
 15861 
 15862          Re-enter GENTLEWOMAN, With VALERIA and an usher
 15863 
 15864   VALERIA. My ladies both, good day to you.
 15865   VOLUMNIA. Sweet madam!
 15866   VIRGILIA. I am glad to see your ladyship.
 15867   VALERIA. How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are
 15868     you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little
 15869     son?
 15870   VIRGILIA. I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
 15871   VOLUMNIA. He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look
 15872     upon his schoolmaster.
 15873   VALERIA. O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very
 15874     pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
 15875     hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run
 15876     after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go
 15877     again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up
 15878     again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how
 15879     'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he
 15880     mammock'd it!
 15881   VOLUMNIA. One on's father's moods.
 15882   VALERIA. Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
 15883   VIRGILIA. A crack, madam.
 15884   VALERIA. Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
 15885     idle huswife with me this afternoon.
 15886   VIRGILIA. No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
 15887   VALERIA. Not out of doors!
 15888   VOLUMNIA. She shall, she shall.
 15889   VIRGILIA. Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold
 15890     till my lord return from the wars.
 15891   VALERIA. Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you
 15892     must go visit the good lady that lies in.
 15893   VIRGILIA. I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
 15894     prayers; but I cannot go thither.
 15895   VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?
 15896   VIRGILIA. 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
 15897   VALERIA. You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
 15898     she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
 15899     Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you
 15900     might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
 15901   VIRGILIA. No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.
 15902   VALERIA. In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
 15903     of your husband.
 15904   VIRGILIA. O, good madam, there can be none yet.
 15905   VALERIA. Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
 15906     last night.
 15907   VIRGILIA. Indeed, madam?
 15908   VALERIA. In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
 15909     is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
 15910     general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and
 15911     Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they
 15912     nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
 15913     on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
 15914   VIRGILIA. Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
 15915     hereafter.
 15916   VOLUMNIA. Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease
 15917     our better mirth.
 15918   VALERIA. In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
 15919     good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
 15920     door and go along with us.
 15921   VIRGILIA. No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much
 15922     mirth.
 15923   VALERIA. Well then, farewell.                           Exeunt
 15924 
 15925 
 15926 
 15927 
 15928 SCENE IV.
 15929 Before Corioli
 15930 
 15931 Enter MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with drum and colours,
 15932 with CAPTAINS and soldiers. To them a MESSENGER
 15933 
 15934   MARCIUS. Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met.
 15935   LARTIUS. My horse to yours- no.
 15936   MARCIUS. 'Tis done.
 15937   LARTIUS. Agreed.
 15938   MARCIUS. Say, has our general met the enemy?
 15939   MESSENGER. They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.
 15940   LARTIUS. So, the good horse is mine.
 15941   MARCIUS. I'll buy him of you.
 15942   LARTIUS. No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
 15943     For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
 15944   MARCIUS. How far off lie these armies?
 15945   MESSENGER. Within this mile and half.
 15946   MARCIUS. Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
 15947     Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
 15948     That we with smoking swords may march from hence
 15949     To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
 15950 
 15951           They sound a parley. Enter two SENATORS with others,
 15952                       on the walls of Corioli
 15953 
 15954     Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
 15955   FIRST SENATOR. No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
 15956     That's lesser than a little.  [Drum afar off]  Hark, our drums
 15957     Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
 15958     Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
 15959     Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
 15960     They'll open of themselves.  [Alarum far off]  Hark you far off!
 15961     There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
 15962     Amongst your cloven army.
 15963   MARCIUS. O, they are at it!
 15964   LARTIUS. Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
 15965 
 15966                    Enter the army of the Volsces
 15967 
 15968   MARCIUS. They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
 15969     Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
 15970     With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus.
 15971     They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
 15972     Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.
 15973     He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
 15974     And he shall feel mine edge.
 15975 
 15976           Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.
 15977                       Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing
 15978 
 15979   MARCIUS. All the contagion of the south light on you,
 15980     You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues
 15981     Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
 15982     Farther than seen, and one infect another
 15983     Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
 15984     That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
 15985     From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
 15986     All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
 15987     With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
 15988     Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
 15989     And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;
 15990     If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,
 15991     As they us to our trenches. Follow me.
 15992 
 15993          Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows
 15994                           them to the gates
 15995 
 15996     So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;
 15997     'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
 15998     Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.
 15999 
 16000                     [MARCIUS enters the gates]
 16001 
 16002   FIRST SOLDIER. Fool-hardiness; not I.
 16003   SECOND SOLDIER. Not I.                    [MARCIUS is shut in]
 16004   FIRST SOLDIER. See, they have shut him in.
 16005   ALL. To th' pot, I warrant him.             [Alarum continues]
 16006 
 16007                       Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS
 16008 
 16009   LARTIUS. What is become of Marcius?
 16010   ALL. Slain, sir, doubtless.
 16011   FIRST SOLDIER. Following the fliers at the very heels,
 16012     With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
 16013     Clapp'd to their gates. He is himself alone,
 16014     To answer all the city.
 16015   LARTIUS. O noble fellow!
 16016     Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
 16017     And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
 16018     A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
 16019     Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
 16020     Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
 16021     Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
 16022     The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
 16023     Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
 16024     Were feverous and did tremble.
 16025 
 16026           Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy
 16027 
 16028   FIRST SOLDIER. Look, sir.
 16029   LARTIUS. O, 'tis Marcius!
 16030     Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
 16031                             [They fight, and all enter the city]
 16032 
 16033 
 16034 
 16035 
 16036 SCENE V.
 16037 Within Corioli. A street
 16038 
 16039 Enter certain Romans, with spoils
 16040 
 16041   FIRST ROMAN. This will I carry to Rome.
 16042   SECOND ROMAN. And I this.
 16043   THIRD ROMAN. A murrain on 't! I took this for silver.
 16044                                [Alarum continues still afar off]
 16045 
 16046           Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trumpeter
 16047 
 16048   MARCIUS. See here these movers that do prize their hours
 16049     At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
 16050     Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
 16051     Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
 16052     Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
 16053                                                 Exeunt pillagers
 16054     And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
 16055     There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
 16056     Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
 16057     Convenient numbers to make good the city;
 16058     Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
 16059     To help Cominius.
 16060   LARTIUS. Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
 16061     Thy exercise hath been too violent
 16062     For a second course of fight.
 16063   MARCIUS. Sir, praise me not;
 16064     My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;
 16065     The blood I drop is rather physical
 16066     Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
 16067     I will appear, and fight.
 16068   LARTIUS. Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
 16069     Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
 16070     Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
 16071     Prosperity be thy page!
 16072   MARCIUS. Thy friend no less
 16073     Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.
 16074   LARTIUS. Thou worthiest Marcius!                  Exit MARCIUS
 16075     Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
 16076     Call thither all the officers o' th' town,
 16077     Where they shall know our mind. Away!                 Exeunt
 16078 
 16079 
 16080 
 16081 
 16082 SCENE VI.
 16083 Near the camp of COMINIUS
 16084 
 16085 Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers
 16086 
 16087   COMINIUS. Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
 16088     Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
 16089     Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
 16090     We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
 16091     By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
 16092     The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
 16093     Lead their successes as we wish our own,
 16094     That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring,
 16095     May give you thankful sacrifice!
 16096 
 16097                          Enter A MESSENGER
 16098 
 16099     Thy news?
 16100   MESSENGER. The citizens of Corioli have issued
 16101     And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
 16102     I saw our party to their trenches driven,
 16103     And then I came away.
 16104   COMINIUS. Though thou speak'st truth,
 16105     Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?
 16106   MESSENGER. Above an hour, my lord.
 16107   COMINIUS. 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
 16108     How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
 16109     And bring thy news so late?
 16110   MESSENGER. Spies of the Volsces
 16111     Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel
 16112     Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,
 16113     Half an hour since brought my report.
 16114 
 16115                            Enter MARCIUS
 16116 
 16117   COMINIUS. Who's yonder
 16118     That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
 16119     He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
 16120     Before-time seen him thus.
 16121   MARCIUS. Come I too late?
 16122   COMINIUS. The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
 16123     More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
 16124     From every meaner man.
 16125   MARCIUS. Come I too late?
 16126   COMINIUS. Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
 16127     But mantled in your own.
 16128   MARCIUS. O! let me clip ye
 16129     In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
 16130     As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
 16131     And tapers burn'd to bedward.
 16132   COMINIUS. Flower of warriors,
 16133     How is't with Titus Lartius?
 16134   MARCIUS. As with a man busied about decrees:
 16135     Condemning some to death and some to exile;
 16136     Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
 16137     Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
 16138     Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
 16139     To let him slip at will.
 16140   COMINIUS. Where is that slave
 16141     Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
 16142     Where is he? Call him hither.
 16143   MARCIUS. Let him alone;
 16144     He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
 16145     The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!
 16146     The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
 16147     From rascals worse than they.
 16148   COMINIUS. But how prevail'd you?
 16149   MARCIUS. Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
 16150     Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
 16151     If not, why cease you till you are so?
 16152   COMINIUS. Marcius,
 16153     We have at disadvantage fought, and did
 16154     Retire to win our purpose.
 16155   MARCIUS. How lies their battle? Know you on which side
 16156     They have plac'd their men of trust?
 16157   COMINIUS. As I guess, Marcius,
 16158     Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
 16159     Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
 16160     Their very heart of hope.
 16161   MARCIUS. I do beseech you,
 16162     By all the battles wherein we have fought,
 16163     By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows
 16164     We have made to endure friends, that you directly
 16165     Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
 16166     And that you not delay the present, but,
 16167     Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,
 16168     We prove this very hour.
 16169   COMINIUS. Though I could wish
 16170     You were conducted to a gentle bath
 16171     And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
 16172     Deny your asking: take your choice of those
 16173     That best can aid your action.
 16174   MARCIUS. Those are they
 16175     That most are willing. If any such be here-
 16176     As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting
 16177     Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
 16178     Lesser his person than an ill report;
 16179     If any think brave death outweighs bad life
 16180     And that his country's dearer than himself;
 16181     Let him alone, or so many so minded,
 16182     Wave thus to express his disposition,
 16183     And follow Marcius.           [They all shout and wave their
 16184        swords, take him up in their arms and cast up their caps]
 16185     O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
 16186     If these shows be not outward, which of you
 16187     But is four Volsces? None of you but is
 16188     Able to bear against the great Aufidius
 16189     A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
 16190     Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest
 16191     Shall bear the business in some other fight,
 16192     As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
 16193     And four shall quickly draw out my command,
 16194     Which men are best inclin'd.
 16195   COMINIUS. March on, my fellows;
 16196     Make good this ostentation, and you shall
 16197     Divide in all with us.                                Exeunt
 16198

 16202 SCENE VII.
 16203 The gates of Corioli
 16204 
 16205 TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet
 16206 toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with a LIEUTENANT, other soldiers,
 16207 and a scout
 16208 
 16209   LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
 16210     As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
 16211     Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
 16212     For a short holding. If we lose the field
 16213     We cannot keep the town.
 16214   LIEUTENANT. Fear not our care, sir.
 16215   LARTIUS. Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
 16216     Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.       Exeunt
 16217 
 16218 
 16219 
 16220 
 16221 SCENE VIII.
 16222 A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
 16223 
 16224 Alarum, as in battle. Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several doors
 16225 
 16226   MARCIUS. I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
 16227     Worse than a promise-breaker.
 16228   AUFIDIUS. We hate alike:
 16229     Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
 16230     More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
 16231   MARCIUS. Let the first budger die the other's slave,
 16232     And the gods doom him after!
 16233   AUFIDIUS. If I fly, Marcius,
 16234     Halloa me like a hare.
 16235   MARCIUS. Within these three hours, Tullus,
 16236     Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
 16237     And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
 16238     Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy revenge
 16239     Wrench up thy power to th' highest.
 16240   AUFIDIUS. Wert thou the Hector
 16241     That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
 16242     Thou shouldst not scape me here.
 16243 
 16244        Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid
 16245         of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
 16246                              breathless
 16247 
 16248     Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me
 16249     In your condemned seconds.                            Exeunt
 16250 
 16251 
 16252 
 16253 
 16254 SCENE IX.
 16255 The Roman camp
 16256 
 16257 Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Enter, at one door,
 16258 COMINIUS with the Romans; at another door, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf
 16259 
 16260   COMINIUS. If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
 16261     Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it
 16262     Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
 16263     Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
 16264     I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
 16265     And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
 16266     That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
 16267     Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
 16268     Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
 16269     Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast,
 16270     Having fully din'd before.
 16271 
 16272          Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit
 16273 
 16274   LARTIUS. O General,
 16275     Here is the steed, we the caparison.
 16276     Hadst thou beheld-
 16277   MARCIUS. Pray now, no more; my mother,
 16278     Who has a charter to extol her blood,
 16279     When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
 16280     As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd
 16281     As you have been- that's for my country.
 16282     He that has but effected his good will
 16283     Hath overta'en mine act.
 16284   COMINIUS. You shall not be
 16285     The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
 16286     The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment
 16287     Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
 16288     To hide your doings and to silence that
 16289     Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
 16290     Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,
 16291     In sign of what you are, not to reward
 16292     What you have done, before our army hear me.
 16293   MARCIUS. I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
 16294     To hear themselves rememb'red.
 16295   COMINIUS. Should they not,
 16296     Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
 16297     And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
 16298     Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
 16299     The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
 16300     We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth
 16301     Before the common distribution at
 16302     Your only choice.
 16303   MARCIUS. I thank you, General,
 16304     But cannot make my heart consent to take
 16305     A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
 16306     And stand upon my common part with those
 16307     That have beheld the doing.
 16308 
 16309            A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
 16310    cast up their caps and lances. COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
 16311 
 16312     May these same instruments which you profane
 16313     Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
 16314     I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
 16315     Made all of false-fac'd soothing. When steel grows
 16316     Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made
 16317     An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
 16318     For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,
 16319     Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note
 16320     Here's many else have done, you shout me forth
 16321     In acclamations hyperbolical,
 16322     As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
 16323     In praises sauc'd with lies.
 16324   COMINIUS. Too modest are you;
 16325     More cruel to your good report than grateful
 16326     To us that give you truly. By your patience,
 16327     If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
 16328     Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles,
 16329     Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
 16330     As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
 16331     Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,
 16332     My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
 16333     With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
 16334     For what he did before Corioli, can him
 16335     With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,
 16336     Caius Marcius Coriolanus.
 16337     Bear th' addition nobly ever!
 16338                            [Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums]
 16339   ALL. Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
 16340   CORIOLANUS. I will go wash;
 16341     And when my face is fair you shall perceive
 16342     Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you;
 16343     I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
 16344     To undercrest your good addition
 16345     To th' fairness of my power.
 16346   COMINIUS. So, to our tent;
 16347     Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
 16348     To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
 16349     Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome
 16350     The best, with whom we may articulate
 16351     For their own good and ours.
 16352   LARTIUS. I shall, my lord.
 16353   CORIOLANUS. The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
 16354     Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg
 16355     Of my Lord General.
 16356   COMINIUS. Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?
 16357   CORIOLANUS. I sometime lay here in Corioli
 16358     At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.
 16359     He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
 16360     But then Aufidius was within my view,
 16361     And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
 16362     To give my poor host freedom.
 16363   COMINIUS. O, well begg'd!
 16364     Were he the butcher of my son, he should
 16365     Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
 16366   LARTIUS. Marcius, his name?
 16367   CORIOLANUS. By Jupiter, forgot!
 16368     I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
 16369     Have we no wine here?
 16370   COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.
 16371     The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
 16372     It should be look'd to. Come.                         Exeunt
 16373 
 16374 
 16375 
 16376 
 16377 SCENE X.
 16378 The camp of the Volsces
 16379 
 16380 A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
 16381 
 16382   AUFIDIUS. The town is ta'en.
 16383   FIRST SOLDIER. 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
 16384   AUFIDIUS. Condition!
 16385     I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
 16386     Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
 16387     What good condition can a treaty find
 16388     I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
 16389     I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
 16390     And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
 16391     As often as we eat. By th' elements,
 16392     If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
 16393     He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation
 16394     Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
 16395     I thought to crush him in an equal force,
 16396     True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
 16397     Or wrath or craft may get him.
 16398   FIRST SOLDIER. He's the devil.
 16399   AUFIDIUS. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
 16400     With only suff'ring stain by him; for him
 16401     Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
 16402     Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
 16403     The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
 16404     Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
 16405     Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
 16406     My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
 16407     At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
 16408     Against the hospitable canon, would I
 16409     Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;
 16410     Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
 16411     Be hostages for Rome.
 16412   FIRST SOLDIER. Will not you go?
 16413   AUFIDIUS. I am attended at the cypress grove; I pray you-
 16414     'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
 16415     How the world goes, that to the pace of it
 16416     I may spur on my journey.
 16417   FIRST SOLDIER. I shall, sir.                            Exeunt

 16433 ACT II. SCENE I.
 16434 Rome. A public place
 16435 
 16436 Enter MENENIUS, with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS
 16437 
 16438   MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
 16439   BRUTUS. Good or bad?
 16440   MENENIUS. Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love
 16441     not Marcius.
 16442   SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
 16443   MENENIUS. Pray you, who does the wolf love?
 16444   SICINIUS. The lamb.
 16445   MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the
 16446     noble Marcius.
 16447   BRUTUS. He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
 16448   MENENIUS. He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb. You two are
 16449     old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
 16450   BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.
 16451   MENENIUS. In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
 16452     in abundance?
 16453   BRUTUS. He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.
 16454   SICINIUS. Especially in pride.
 16455   BRUTUS. And topping all others in boasting.
 16456   MENENIUS. This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured
 16457     here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you?
 16458   BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd?
 16459   MENENIUS. Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?
 16460   BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well.
 16461   MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
 16462     occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your
 16463     dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the
 16464     least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame
 16465     Marcius for being proud?
 16466   BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir.
 16467   MENENIUS. I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are
 16468     many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your
 16469     abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of
 16470     pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
 16471     necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
 16472     that you could!
 16473   BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir?
 16474   MENENIUS. Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
 16475     proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.
 16476   SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known well enough too.
 16477   MENENIUS. I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves
 16478     a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
 16479     be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
 16480     and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
 16481     with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
 16482     morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
 16483     Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you
 16484     Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I
 16485     make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have
 16486     deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with
 16487     the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to
 16488     bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie
 16489     deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the
 16490     map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too?
 16491     What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
 16492     character, if I be known well enough too?
 16493   BRUTUS. Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
 16494   MENENIUS. You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are
 16495     ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good
 16496     wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and
 16497     a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
 16498     to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter
 16499     between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the
 16500     colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag
 16501     against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss
 16502     the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All
 16503     the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
 16504     knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.
 16505   BRUTUS. Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
 16506     for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
 16507   MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
 16508     encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak
 16509     best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your
 16510     beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
 16511     stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
 16512     pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a
 16513     cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;
 16514     though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
 16515     hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation
 16516     would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
 16517     plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.
 16518                                   [BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]
 16519 
 16520                Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
 16521 
 16522     How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon, were she
 16523     earthly, no nobler- whither do you follow your eyes so fast?
 16524   VOLUMNIA. Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the
 16525     love of Juno, let's go.
 16526   MENENIUS. Ha! Marcius coming home?
 16527   VOLUMNIA. Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous
 16528     approbation.
 16529   MENENIUS. Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
 16530     Marcius coming home!
 16531   VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA. Nay, 'tis true.
 16532   VOLUMNIA. Look, here's a letter from him; the state hath another,
 16533     his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you.
 16534   MENENIUS. I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?
 16535   VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
 16536   MENENIUS. A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'
 16537     health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The
 16538     most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to
 16539     this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
 16540     not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.
 16541   VIRGILIA. O, no, no, no.
 16542   VOLUMNIA. O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.
 16543   MENENIUS. So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a victory in
 16544     his pocket? The wounds become him.
 16545   VOLUMNIA. On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with
 16546     the oaken garland.
 16547   MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?
 16548   VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius
 16549     got off.
 16550   MENENIUS. And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he
 16551     had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the
 16552     chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate
 16553     possess'd of this?
 16554   VOLUMNIA. Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has
 16555     letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name
 16556     of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former deeds
 16557     doubly.
 16558   VALERIA. In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
 16559   MENENIUS. Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true
 16560     purchasing.
 16561   VIRGILIA. The gods grant them true!
 16562   VOLUMNIA. True! pow, waw.
 16563   MENENIUS. True! I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?
 16564     [To the TRIBUNES]  God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
 16565     home; he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
 16566   VOLUMNIA. I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there will be large
 16567     cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
 16568     He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body.
 16569   MENENIUS. One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I
 16570     know.
 16571   VOLUMNIA. He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds
 16572     upon him.
 16573   MENENIUS. Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave.
 16574     [A shout and flourish]  Hark! the trumpets.
 16575   VOLUMNIA. These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries
 16576       noise, and behind him he leaves tears;
 16577     Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie,
 16578     Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.
 16579 
 16580             A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
 16581               GENERAL, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them,
 16582            CORIOLANUS, crown'd with an oaken garland; with
 16583                    CAPTAINS and soldiers and a HERALD
 16584 
 16585   HERALD. Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
 16586     Within Corioli gates, where he hath won,
 16587     With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
 16588     In honour follows Coriolanus.
 16589     Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!             [Flourish]
 16590   ALL. Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
 16591   CORIOLANUS. No more of this, it does offend my heart.
 16592     Pray now, no more.
 16593   COMINIUS. Look, sir, your mother!
 16594   CORIOLANUS. O,
 16595     You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
 16596     For my prosperity!                                  [Kneels]
 16597   VOLUMNIA. Nay, my good soldier, up;
 16598     My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
 16599     By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-
 16600     What is it? Coriolanus must I can thee?
 16601     But, O, thy wife!
 16602   CORIOLANUS. My gracious silence, hail!
 16603     Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
 16604     That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
 16605     Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
 16606     And mothers that lack sons.
 16607   MENENIUS. Now the gods crown thee!
 16608   CORIOLANUS. And live you yet?  [To VALERIA]  O my sweet lady,
 16609     pardon.
 16610   VOLUMNIA. I know not where to turn.
 16611     O, welcome home! And welcome, General.
 16612     And y'are welcome all.
 16613   MENENIUS. A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
 16614     And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!
 16615     A curse begin at very root on's heart
 16616     That is not glad to see thee! You are three
 16617     That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,
 16618     We have some old crab trees here at home that will not
 16619     Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.
 16620     We call a nettle but a nettle, and
 16621     The faults of fools but folly.
 16622   COMINIUS. Ever right.
 16623   CORIOLANUS. Menenius ever, ever.
 16624   HERALD. Give way there, and go on.
 16625   CORIOLANUS.  [To his wife and mother]  Your hand, and yours.
 16626     Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
 16627     The good patricians must be visited;
 16628     From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,
 16629     But with them change of honours.
 16630   VOLUMNIA. I have lived
 16631     To see inherited my very wishes,
 16632     And the buildings of my fancy; only
 16633     There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
 16634     Our Rome will cast upon thee.
 16635   CORIOLANUS. Know, good mother,
 16636     I had rather be their servant in my way
 16637     Than sway with them in theirs.
 16638   COMINIUS. On, to the Capitol.
 16639                  [Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before]
 16640 
 16641                 BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
 16642 
 16643   BRUTUS. All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
 16644     Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
 16645     Into a rapture lets her baby cry
 16646     While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
 16647     Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
 16648     Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,
 16649     Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
 16650     With variable complexions, all agreeing
 16651     In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
 16652     Do press among the popular throngs and puff
 16653     To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames
 16654     Commit the war of white and damask in
 16655     Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
 16656     Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
 16657     As if that whatsoever god who leads him
 16658     Were slily crept into his human powers,
 16659     And gave him graceful posture.
 16660   SICINIUS. On the sudden
 16661     I warrant him consul.
 16662   BRUTUS. Then our office may
 16663     During his power go sleep.
 16664   SICINIUS. He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
 16665     From where he should begin and end, but will
 16666     Lose those he hath won.
 16667   BRUTUS. In that there's comfort.
 16668   SICINIUS. Doubt not
 16669     The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
 16670     Upon their ancient malice will forget
 16671     With the least cause these his new honours; which
 16672     That he will give them make I as little question
 16673     As he is proud to do't.
 16674   BRUTUS. I heard him swear,
 16675     Were he to stand for consul, never would he
 16676     Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put
 16677     The napless vesture of humility;
 16678     Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
 16679     To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.
 16680   SICINIUS. 'Tis right.
 16681   BRUTUS. It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
 16682     Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
 16683     And the desire of the nobles.
 16684   SICINIUS. I wish no better
 16685     Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
 16686     In execution.
 16687   BRUTUS. 'Tis most like he will.
 16688   SICINIUS. It shall be to him then as our good wills:
 16689     A sure destruction.
 16690   BRUTUS. So it must fall out
 16691     To him or our authorities. For an end,
 16692     We must suggest the people in what hatred
 16693     He still hath held them; that to's power he would
 16694     Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
 16695     Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
 16696     In human action and capacity
 16697     Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
 16698     Than camels in their war, who have their provand
 16699     Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
 16700     For sinking under them.
 16701   SICINIUS. This, as you say, suggested
 16702     At some time when his soaring insolence
 16703     Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
 16704     If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
 16705     As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
 16706     To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
 16707     Shall darken him for ever.
 16708 
 16709                            Enter A MESSENGER
 16710 
 16711   BRUTUS. What's the matter?
 16712   MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
 16713     That Marcius shall be consul.
 16714     I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
 16715     The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
 16716     Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
 16717     Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
 16718     As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
 16719     A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
 16720     I never saw the like.
 16721   BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol,
 16722     And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
 16723     But hearts for the event.
 16724   SICINIUS. Have with you.                                Exeunt
 16725 
 16726 
 16727 
 16728 
 16729 SCENE II.
 16730 Rome. The Capitol
 16731 
 16732 Enter two OFFICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol
 16733 
 16734   FIRST OFFICER. Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for
 16735     consulships?
 16736   SECOND OFFICER. Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one
 16737     Coriolanus will carry it.
 16738   FIRST OFFICER. That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and
 16739     loves not the common people.
 16740   SECOND OFFICER. Faith, there have been many great men that have
 16741     flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many
 16742     that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they
 16743     love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.
 16744     Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
 16745     hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
 16746     disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
 16747     see't.
 16748   FIRST OFFICER. If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
 16749     he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;
 16750     but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
 16751     render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
 16752     him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and
 16753     displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to
 16754     flatter them for their love.
 16755   SECOND OFFICER. He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his
 16756     ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been
 16757     supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further
 16758     deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but
 16759     he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
 16760     their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
 16761     so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise
 16762     were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof
 16763     and rebuke from every car that heard it.
 16764   FIRST OFFICER. No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they
 16765     are coming.
 16766 
 16767          A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
 16768          OF THE PEOPLE, LICTORS before them; CORIOLANUS,
 16769             MENENIUS, COMINIUS the Consul. SICINIUS and
 16770                BRUTUS take their places by themselves.
 16771                          CORIOLANUS stands
 16772 
 16773   MENENIUS. Having determin'd of the Volsces, and
 16774     To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
 16775     As the main point of this our after-meeting,
 16776     To gratify his noble service that
 16777     Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,
 16778     Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
 16779     The present consul and last general
 16780     In our well-found successes to report
 16781     A little of that worthy work perform'd
 16782     By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom
 16783     We met here both to thank and to remember
 16784     With honours like himself.                 [CORIOLANUS sits]
 16785   FIRST SENATOR. Speak, good Cominius.
 16786     Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
 16787     Rather our state's defective for requital
 16788     Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people,
 16789     We do request your kindest ears; and, after,
 16790     Your loving motion toward the common body,
 16791     To yield what passes here.
 16792   SICINIUS. We are convented
 16793     Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
 16794     Inclinable to honour and advance
 16795     The theme of our assembly.
 16796   BRUTUS. Which the rather
 16797     We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember
 16798     A kinder value of the people than
 16799     He hath hereto priz'd them at.
 16800   MENENIUS. That's off, that's off;
 16801     I would you rather had been silent. Please you
 16802     To hear Cominius speak?
 16803   BRUTUS. Most willingly.
 16804     But yet my caution was more pertinent
 16805     Than the rebuke you give it.
 16806   MENENIUS. He loves your people;
 16807     But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
 16808     Worthy Cominius, speak.
 16809                        [CORIOLANUS rises, and offers to go away]
 16810     Nay, keep your place.
 16811   FIRST SENATOR. Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear
 16812     What you have nobly done.
 16813   CORIOLANUS. Your Honours' pardon.
 16814     I had rather have my wounds to heal again
 16815     Than hear say how I got them.
 16816   BRUTUS. Sir, I hope
 16817     My words disbench'd you not.
 16818   CORIOLANUS. No, sir; yet oft,
 16819     When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
 16820     You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people,
 16821     I love them as they weigh-
 16822   MENENIUS. Pray now, sit down.
 16823   CORIOLANUS. I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun
 16824     When the alarum were struck than idly sit
 16825     To hear my nothings monster'd.                          Exit
 16826   MENENIUS. Masters of the people,
 16827     Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-
 16828     That's thousand to one good one- when you now see
 16829     He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
 16830     Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
 16831   COMINIUS. I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus
 16832     Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
 16833     That valour is the chiefest virtue and
 16834     Most dignifies the haver. If it be,
 16835     The man I speak of cannot in the world
 16836     Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,
 16837     When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
 16838     Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,
 16839     Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight
 16840     When with his Amazonian chin he drove
 16841     The bristled lips before him; he bestrid
 16842     An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
 16843     Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,
 16844     And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
 16845     When he might act the woman in the scene,
 16846     He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed
 16847     Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
 16848     Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,
 16849     And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
 16850     He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
 16851     Before and in Corioli, let me say
 16852     I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,
 16853     And by his rare example made the coward
 16854     Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
 16855     A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
 16856     And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
 16857     Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
 16858     He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
 16859     Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red
 16860     The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted
 16861     With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
 16862     And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
 16863     Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.
 16864     When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
 16865     His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
 16866     Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,
 16867     And to the battle came he; where he did
 16868     Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
 16869     'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd
 16870     Both field and city ours he never stood
 16871     To ease his breast with panting.
 16872   MENENIUS. Worthy man!
 16873   FIRST SENATOR. He cannot but with measure fit the honours
 16874     Which we devise him.
 16875   COMINIUS. Our spoils he kick'd at,
 16876     And look'd upon things precious as they were
 16877     The common muck of the world. He covets less
 16878     Than misery itself would give, rewards
 16879     His deeds with doing them, and is content
 16880     To spend the time to end it.
 16881   MENENIUS. He's right noble;
 16882     Let him be call'd for.
 16883   FIRST SENATOR. Call Coriolanus.
 16884     OFFICER. He doth appear.
 16885 
 16886                             Re-enter CORIOLANUS
 16887 
 16888   MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
 16889     To make thee consul.
 16890   CORIOLANUS. I do owe them still
 16891     My life and services.
 16892   MENENIUS. It then remains
 16893     That you do speak to the people.
 16894   CORIOLANUS. I do beseech you
 16895     Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot
 16896     Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them
 16897     For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you
 16898     That I may pass this doing.
 16899   SICINIUS. Sir, the people
 16900     Must have their voices; neither will they bate
 16901     One jot of ceremony.
 16902   MENENIUS. Put them not to't.
 16903     Pray you go fit you to the custom, and
 16904     Take to you, as your predecessors have,
 16905     Your honour with your form.
 16906   CORIOLANUS. It is a part
 16907     That I shall blush in acting, and might well
 16908     Be taken from the people.
 16909   BRUTUS. Mark you that?
 16910   CORIOLANUS. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'
 16911     Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,
 16912     As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
 16913     Of their breath only!
 16914   MENENIUS. Do not stand upon't.
 16915     We recommend to you, Tribunes of the People,
 16916     Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul
 16917     Wish we all joy and honour.
 16918   SENATORS. To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
 16919                              [Flourish. Cornets. Then exeunt all
 16920                                         but SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
 16921   BRUTUS. You see how he intends to use the people.
 16922   SICINIUS. May they perceive's intent! He will require them
 16923     As if he did contemn what he requested
 16924     Should be in them to give.
 16925   BRUTUS. Come, we'll inform them
 16926     Of our proceedings here. On th' market-place
 16927     I know they do attend us.                             Exeunt
 16928 
 16929 
 16930 
 16931 
 16932 SCENE III.
 16933 Rome. The Forum
 16934 
 16935 Enter seven or eight citizens
 16936 
 16937   FIRST CITIZEN. Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to
 16938     deny him.
 16939   SECOND CITIZEN. We may, sir, if we will.
 16940   THIRD CITIZEN. We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
 16941     power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds
 16942     and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those
 16943     wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we
 16944     must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
 16945     monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
 16946     monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should
 16947     bring ourselves to be monstrous members.
 16948   FIRST CITIZEN. And to make us no better thought of, a little help
 16949     will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
 16950     not to call us the many-headed multitude.
 16951   THIRD CITIZEN. We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads
 16952     are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our
 16953     wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits
 16954     were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north,
 16955     south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
 16956     all the points o' th' compass.
 16957   SECOND CITIZEN. Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
 16958     fly?
 16959   THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
 16960     will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
 16961     liberty 'twould sure southward.
 16962   SECOND CITIZEN. Why that way?
 16963   THIRD CITIZEN. To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts
 16964    melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for
 16965     conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.
 16966   SECOND CITIZEN. YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you
 16967     may.
 16968   THIRD CITIZEN. Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's
 16969     no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would
 16970     incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.
 16971 
 16972                 Enter CORIOLANUS, in a gown of humility,
 16973                                with MENENIUS
 16974 
 16975     Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.
 16976     We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he
 16977     stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his
 16978     requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
 16979     honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues;
 16980     therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him.
 16981   ALL. Content, content.                         Exeunt citizens
 16982   MENENIUS. O sir, you are not right; have you not known
 16983     The worthiest men have done't?
 16984   CORIOLANUS. What must I say?
 16985     'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I cannot bring
 16986     My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds
 16987     I got them in my country's service, when
 16988     Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
 16989     From th' noise of our own drums.'
 16990   MENENIUS. O me, the gods!
 16991     You must not speak of that. You must desire them
 16992     To think upon you.
 16993   CORIOLANUS. Think upon me? Hang 'em!
 16994     I would they would forget me, like the virtues
 16995     Which our divines lose by 'em.
 16996   MENENIUS. You'll mar all.
 16997     I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,
 16998     In wholesome manner.                                    Exit
 16999 
 17000                        Re-enter three of the citizens
 17001 
 17002   CORIOLANUS. Bid them wash their faces
 17003     And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.
 17004     You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.
 17005   THIRD CITIZEN. We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
 17006   CORIOLANUS. Mine own desert.
 17007   SECOND CITIZEN. Your own desert?
 17008   CORIOLANUS. Ay, not mine own desire.
 17009   THIRD CITIZEN. How, not your own desire?
 17010   CORIOLANUS. No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
 17011     with begging.
 17012   THIRD CITIZEN. YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to
 17013     gain by you.
 17014   CORIOLANUS. Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?
 17015   FIRST CITIZEN. The price is to ask it kindly.
 17016   CORIOLANUS. Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show
 17017     you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what
 17018     say you?
 17019   SECOND CITIZEN. You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
 17020   CORIOLANUS. A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.
 17021     I have your alms. Adieu.
 17022   THIRD CITIZEN. But this is something odd.
 17023   SECOND CITIZEN. An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.
 17024                                        Exeunt the three citizens
 17025 
 17026                       Re-enter two other citizens
 17027 
 17028   CORIOLANUS. Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
 17029     voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.
 17030   FOURTH CITIZEN. You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
 17031     have not deserved nobly.
 17032   CORIOLANUS. Your enigma?
 17033   FOURTH CITIZEN. You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have
 17034     been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common
 17035     people.
 17036   CORIOLANUS. You should account me the more virtuous, that I have
 17037     not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn
 17038     brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
 17039     condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their
 17040     choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
 17041     the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That
 17042     is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
 17043     and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I
 17044     may be consul.
 17045   FIFTH CITIZEN. We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
 17046     you our voices heartily.
 17047   FOURTH CITIZEN. You have received many wounds for your country.
 17048   CORIOLANUS. I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
 17049     will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.
 17050   BOTH CITIZENS. The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
 17051                                                  Exeunt citizens
 17052   CORIOLANUS. Most sweet voices!
 17053     Better it is to die, better to starve,
 17054     Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
 17055     Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
 17056     To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
 17057     Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
 17058     What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
 17059     The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
 17060     And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
 17061     For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
 17062     Let the high office and the honour go
 17063     To one that would do thus. I am half through:
 17064     The one part suffered, the other will I do.
 17065 
 17066                       Re-enter three citizens more
 17067 
 17068     Here come moe voices.
 17069     Your voices. For your voices I have fought;
 17070     Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
 17071     Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
 17072     I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
 17073     Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices?
 17074     Indeed, I would be consul.
 17075   SIXTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
 17076     man's voice.
 17077   SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him
 17078     joy, and make him good friend to the people!
 17079   ALL. Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
 17080                                                  Exeunt citizens
 17081   CORIOLANUS. Worthy voices!
 17082 
 17083              Re-enter MENENIUS with BRUTUS and SICINIUS
 17084 
 17085   MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
 17086     Endue you with the people's voice. Remains
 17087     That, in th' official marks invested, you
 17088     Anon do meet the Senate.
 17089   CORIOLANUS. Is this done?
 17090   SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd.
 17091     The people do admit you, and are summon'd
 17092     To meet anon, upon your approbation.
 17093   CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House?
 17094   SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus.
 17095   CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments?
 17096   SICINIUS. You may, sir.
 17097   CORIOLANUS. That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
 17098     Repair to th' Senate House.
 17099   MENENIUS. I'll keep you company. Will you along?
 17100   BRUTUS. We stay here for the people.
 17101   SICINIUS. Fare you well.
 17102                                   Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
 17103     He has it now; and by his looks methinks
 17104     'Tis warm at's heart.
 17105   BRUTUS. With a proud heart he wore
 17106     His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?
 17107 
 17108                             Re-enter citizens
 17109 
 17110   SICINIUS. How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
 17111   FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voices, sir.
 17112   BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
 17113   SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
 17114     He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
 17115   THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly;
 17116     He flouted us downright.
 17117   FIRST CITIZEN. No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.
 17118   SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
 17119     He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us
 17120     His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.
 17121   SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.
 17122   ALL. No, no; no man saw 'em.
 17123   THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had wounds which he could show in
 17124       private,
 17125     And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
 17126     'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom
 17127     But by your voices will not so permit me;
 17128     Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
 17129     Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you,
 17130     Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,
 17131     I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
 17132   SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to see't,
 17133     Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
 17134     To yield your voices?
 17135   BRUTUS. Could you not have told him-
 17136     As you were lesson'd- when he had no power
 17137     But was a petty servant to the state,
 17138     He was your enemy; ever spake against
 17139     Your liberties and the charters that you bear
 17140     I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
 17141     A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
 17142     If he should still malignantly remain
 17143     Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might
 17144     Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
 17145     That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
 17146     Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
 17147     Would think upon you for your voices, and
 17148     Translate his malice towards you into love,
 17149     Standing your friendly lord.
 17150   SICINIUS. Thus to have said,
 17151     As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
 17152     And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
 17153     Either his gracious promise, which you might,
 17154     As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
 17155     Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
 17156     Which easily endures not article
 17157     Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
 17158     You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
 17159     And pass'd him unelected.
 17160   BRUTUS. Did you perceive
 17161     He did solicit you in free contempt
 17162     When he did need your loves; and do you think
 17163     That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
 17164     When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
 17165     No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
 17166     Against the rectorship of judgment?
 17167   SICINIUS. Have you
 17168     Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
 17169     Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
 17170     Your su'd-for tongues?
 17171   THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
 17172   SECOND CITIZENS. And will deny him;
 17173     I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
 17174   FIRST CITIZEN. I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece
 17175     'em.
 17176   BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
 17177     They have chose a consul that will from them take
 17178     Their liberties, make them of no more voice
 17179     Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
 17180     As therefore kept to do so.
 17181   SICINIUS. Let them assemble;
 17182     And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
 17183     Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
 17184     And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
 17185     With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
 17186     How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
 17187     Thinking upon his services, took from you
 17188     Th' apprehension of his present portance,
 17189     Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
 17190     After the inveterate hate he bears you.
 17191   BRUTUS. Lay
 17192     A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
 17193     No impediment between, but that you must
 17194     Cast your election on him.
 17195   SICINIUS. Say you chose him
 17196     More after our commandment than as guided
 17197     By your own true affections; and that your minds,
 17198     Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
 17199     Than what you should, made you against the grain
 17200     To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
 17201   BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
 17202     How youngly he began to serve his country,
 17203     How long continued; and what stock he springs of-
 17204     The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came
 17205     That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
 17206     Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
 17207     Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
 17208     That our best water brought by conduits hither;
 17209     And Censorinus, nobly named so,
 17210     Twice being by the people chosen censor,
 17211     Was his great ancestor.
 17212   SICINIUS. One thus descended,
 17213     That hath beside well in his person wrought
 17214     To be set high in place, we did commend
 17215     To your remembrances; but you have found,
 17216     Scaling his present bearing with his past,
 17217     That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
 17218     Your sudden approbation.
 17219   BRUTUS. Say you ne'er had done't-
 17220     Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
 17221     And presently, when you have drawn your number,
 17222     Repair to th' Capitol.
 17223   CITIZENS. will will so; almost all
 17224     Repent in their election.                   Exeunt plebeians
 17225   BRUTUS. Let them go on;
 17226     This mutiny were better put in hazard
 17227     Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
 17228     If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
 17229     With their refusal, both observe and answer
 17230     The vantage of his anger.
 17231   SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come.
 17232     We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
 17233     And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
 17234     Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt
 17235

 17239 ACT III. SCENE I.
 17240 Rome. A street
 17241 
 17242 Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS,
 17243 TITUS LARTIUS, and other SENATORS
 17244 
 17245   CORIOLANUS. Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?
 17246   LARTIUS. He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
 17247     Our swifter composition.
 17248   CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
 17249     Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
 17250     Upon's again.
 17251   COMINIUS. They are worn, Lord Consul, so
 17252     That we shall hardly in our ages see
 17253     Their banners wave again.
 17254   CORIOLANUS. Saw you Aufidius?
 17255   LARTIUS. On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
 17256     Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
 17257     Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.
 17258   CORIOLANUS. Spoke he of me?
 17259   LARTIUS. He did, my lord.
 17260   CORIOLANUS. How? What?
 17261   LARTIUS. How often he had met you, sword to sword;
 17262     That of all things upon the earth he hated
 17263     Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
 17264     To hopeless restitution, so he might
 17265     Be call'd your vanquisher.
 17266   CORIOLANUS. At Antium lives he?
 17267   LARTIUS. At Antium.
 17268   CORIOLANUS. I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
 17269     To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
 17270 
 17271                        Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
 17272 
 17273     Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
 17274     The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,
 17275     For they do prank them in authority,
 17276     Against all noble sufferance.
 17277   SICINIUS. Pass no further.
 17278   CORIOLANUS. Ha! What is that?
 17279   BRUTUS. It will be dangerous to go on- no further.
 17280   CORIOLANUS. What makes this change?
 17281   MENENIUS. The matter?
 17282   COMINIUS. Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
 17283   BRUTUS. Cominius, no.
 17284   CORIOLANUS. Have I had children's voices?
 17285   FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.
 17286   BRUTUS. The people are incens'd against him.
 17287   SICINIUS. Stop,
 17288     Or all will fall in broil.
 17289   CORIOLANUS. Are these your herd?
 17290     Must these have voices, that can yield them now
 17291     And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
 17292     You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
 17293     Have you not set them on?
 17294   MENENIUS. Be calm, be calm.
 17295   CORIOLANUS. It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
 17296     To curb the will of the nobility;
 17297     Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
 17298     Nor ever will be rul'd.
 17299   BRUTUS. Call't not a plot.
 17300     The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,
 17301     When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
 17302     Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
 17303     Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
 17304   CORIOLANUS. Why, this was known before.
 17305   BRUTUS. Not to them all.
 17306   CORIOLANUS. Have you inform'd them sithence?
 17307   BRUTUS. How? I inform them!
 17308   COMINIUS. You are like to do such business.
 17309   BRUTUS. Not unlike
 17310     Each way to better yours.
 17311   CORIOLANUS. Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
 17312     Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
 17313     Your fellow tribune.
 17314   SICINIUS. You show too much of that
 17315     For which the people stir; if you will pass
 17316     To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
 17317     Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
 17318     Or never be so noble as a consul,
 17319     Nor yoke with him for tribune.
 17320   MENENIUS. Let's be calm.
 17321   COMINIUS. The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
 17322     Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
 17323     Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
 17324     I' th' plain way of his merit.
 17325   CORIOLANUS. Tell me of corn!
 17326     This was my speech, and I will speak't again-
 17327   MENENIUS. Not now, not now.
 17328   FIRST SENATOR. Not in this heat, sir, now.
 17329   CORIOLANUS. Now, as I live, I will.
 17330     My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
 17331     For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
 17332     Regard me as I do not flatter, and
 17333     Therein behold themselves. I say again,
 17334     In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
 17335     The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
 17336     Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
 17337     By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
 17338     Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
 17339     Which they have given to beggars.
 17340   MENENIUS. Well, no more.
 17341   FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we beseech you.
 17342   CORIOLANUS. How? no more!
 17343     As for my country I have shed my blood,
 17344     Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
 17345     Coin words till their decay against those measles
 17346     Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
 17347     The very way to catch them.
 17348   BRUTUS. You speak o' th' people
 17349     As if you were a god, to punish; not
 17350     A man of their infirmity.
 17351   SICINIUS. 'Twere well
 17352     We let the people know't.
 17353   MENENIUS. What, what? his choler?
 17354   CORIOLANUS. Choler!
 17355     Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
 17356     By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
 17357   SICINIUS. It is a mind
 17358     That shall remain a poison where it is,
 17359     Not poison any further.
 17360   CORIOLANUS. Shall remain!
 17361     Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
 17362     His absolute 'shall'?
 17363   COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon.
 17364   CORIOLANUS. 'Shall'!
 17365     O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
 17366     You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
 17367     Given Hydra here to choose an officer
 17368     That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
 17369     The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit
 17370     To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
 17371     And make your channel his? If he have power,
 17372     Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
 17373     Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
 17374     Be not as common fools; if you are not,
 17375     Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
 17376     If they be senators; and they are no less,
 17377     When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
 17378     Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;
 17379     And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
 17380     His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
 17381     Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
 17382     It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
 17383     To know, when two authorities are up,
 17384     Neither supreme, how soon confusion
 17385     May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
 17386     The one by th' other.
 17387   COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-place.
 17388   CORIOLANUS. Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
 17389     The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd
 17390     Sometime in Greece-
 17391   MENENIUS. Well, well, no more of that.
 17392   CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
 17393     I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed
 17394     The ruin of the state.
 17395   BRUTUS. Why shall the people give
 17396     One that speaks thus their voice?
 17397   CORIOLANUS. I'll give my reasons,
 17398     More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
 17399     Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
 17400     They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war
 17401     Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
 17402     They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
 17403     Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,
 17404     Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
 17405     Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation
 17406     Which they have often made against the Senate,
 17407     All cause unborn, could never be the native
 17408     Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
 17409     How shall this bosom multiplied digest
 17410     The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
 17411     What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
 17412     We are the greater poll, and in true fear
 17413     They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
 17414     The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
 17415     Call our cares fears; which will in time
 17416     Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in
 17417     The crows to peck the eagles.
 17418   MENENIUS. Come, enough.
 17419   BRUTUS. Enough, with over measure.
 17420   CORIOLANUS. No, take more.
 17421     What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
 17422     Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
 17423     Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
 17424     Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
 17425     Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
 17426     Of general ignorance- it must omit
 17427     Real necessities, and give way the while
 17428     To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows
 17429     Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you-
 17430     You that will be less fearful than discreet;
 17431     That love the fundamental part of state
 17432     More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer
 17433     A noble life before a long, and wish
 17434     To jump a body with a dangerous physic
 17435     That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out
 17436     The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
 17437     The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
 17438     Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
 17439     Of that integrity which should become't,
 17440     Not having the power to do the good it would,
 17441     For th' ill which doth control't.
 17442   BRUTUS. Has said enough.
 17443   SICINIUS. Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
 17444     As traitors do.
 17445   CORIOLANUS. Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
 17446     What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
 17447     On whom depending, their obedience fails
 17448     To the greater bench? In a rebellion,
 17449     When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
 17450     Then were they chosen; in a better hour
 17451     Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
 17452     And throw their power i' th' dust.
 17453   BRUTUS. Manifest treason!
 17454   SICINIUS. This a consul? No.
 17455   BRUTUS. The aediles, ho!
 17456 
 17457                            Enter an AEDILE
 17458 
 17459     Let him be apprehended.
 17460   SICINIUS. Go call the people,  [Exit AEDILE]  in whose name myself
 17461     Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
 17462     A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
 17463     And follow to thine answer.
 17464   CORIOLANUS. Hence, old goat!
 17465   PATRICIANS. We'll surety him.
 17466   COMINIUS. Ag'd sir, hands off.
 17467   CORIOLANUS. Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
 17468     Out of thy garments.
 17469   SICINIUS. Help, ye citizens!
 17470 
 17471               Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES
 17472 
 17473   MENENIUS. On both sides more respect.
 17474   SICINIUS. Here's he that would take from you all your power.
 17475   BRUTUS. Seize him, aediles.
 17476     PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him!
 17477   SECOND SENATOR. Weapons, weapons, weapons!
 17478                               [They all bustle about CORIOLANUS]
 17479   ALL. Tribunes! patricians! citizens! What, ho! Sicinius!
 17480     Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!
 17481   PATRICIANS. Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace!
 17482   MENENIUS. What is about to be? I am out of breath;
 17483     Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You tribunes
 17484     To th' people- Coriolanus, patience!
 17485     Speak, good Sicinius.
 17486   SICINIUS. Hear me, people; peace!
 17487   PLEBEIANS. Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.
 17488   SICINIUS. You are at point to lose your liberties.
 17489     Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
 17490     Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
 17491   MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!
 17492     This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
 17493   FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
 17494   SICINIUS. What is the city but the people?
 17495   PLEBEIANS. True,
 17496     The people are the city.
 17497   BRUTUS. By the consent of all we were establish'd
 17498     The people's magistrates.
 17499   PLEBEIANS. You so remain.
 17500   MENENIUS. And so are like to do.
 17501   COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat,
 17502     To bring the roof to the foundation,
 17503     And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
 17504     In heaps and piles of ruin.
 17505   SICINIUS. This deserves death.
 17506   BRUTUS. Or let us stand to our authority
 17507     Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
 17508     Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power
 17509     We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy
 17510     Of present death.
 17511   SICINIUS. Therefore lay hold of him;
 17512     Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
 17513     Into destruction cast him.
 17514   BRUTUS. AEdiles, seize him.
 17515   PLEBEIANS. Yield, Marcius, yield.
 17516   MENENIUS. Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,
 17517     Hear me but a word.
 17518   AEDILES. Peace, peace!
 17519   MENENIUS. Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,
 17520     And temp'rately proceed to what you would
 17521     Thus violently redress.
 17522   BRUTUS. Sir, those cold ways,
 17523     That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
 17524     Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him
 17525     And bear him to the rock.
 17526                                     [CORIOLANUS draws his sword]
 17527   CORIOLANUS. No: I'll die here.
 17528     There's some among you have beheld me fighting;
 17529     Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
 17530   MENENIUS. Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
 17531   BRUTUS. Lay hands upon him.
 17532   MENENIUS. Help Marcius, help,
 17533     You that be noble; help him, young and old.
 17534   PLEBEIANS. Down with him, down with him!
 17535                       [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES,
 17536                                      and the people are beat in]
 17537   MENENIUS. Go, get you to your house; be gone, away.
 17538     All will be nought else.
 17539   SECOND SENATOR. Get you gone.
 17540   CORIOLANUS. Stand fast;
 17541     We have as many friends as enemies.
 17542   MENENIUS. Shall it be put to that?
 17543   FIRST SENATOR. The gods forbid!
 17544     I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
 17545     Leave us to cure this cause.
 17546   MENENIUS. For 'tis a sore upon us
 17547     You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.
 17548   COMINIUS. Come, sir, along with us.
 17549   CORIOLANUS. I would they were barbarians, as they are,
 17550     Though in Rome litter'd; not Romans, as they are not,
 17551     Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.
 17552   MENENIUS. Be gone.
 17553     Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
 17554     One time will owe another.
 17555   CORIOLANUS. On fair ground
 17556     I could beat forty of them.
 17557   MENENIUS. I could myself
 17558     Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes.
 17559   COMINIUS. But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
 17560     And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
 17561     Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
 17562     Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
 17563     Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear
 17564     What they are us'd to bear.
 17565   MENENIUS. Pray you be gone.
 17566     I'll try whether my old wit be in request
 17567     With those that have but little; this must be patch'd
 17568     With cloth of any colour.
 17569   COMINIUS. Nay, come away.
 17570                      Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS, with others
 17571   PATRICIANS. This man has marr'd his fortune.
 17572   MENENIUS. His nature is too noble for the world:
 17573     He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
 17574     Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;
 17575     What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
 17576     And, being angry, does forget that ever
 17577     He heard the name of death.                 [A noise within]
 17578     Here's goodly work!
 17579   PATRICIANS. I would they were a-bed.
 17580   MENENIUS. I would they were in Tiber.
 17581     What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?
 17582 
 17583             Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, the rabble again
 17584 
 17585   SICINIUS. Where is this viper
 17586     That would depopulate the city and
 17587     Be every man himself?
 17588   MENENIUS. You worthy Tribunes-
 17589   SICINIUS. He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
 17590     With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,
 17591     And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
 17592     Than the severity of the public power,
 17593     Which he so sets at nought.
 17594   FIRST CITIZEN. He shall well know
 17595     The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
 17596     And we their hands.
 17597   PLEBEIANS. He shall, sure on't.
 17598   MENENIUS. Sir, sir-
 17599   SICINIUS. Peace!
 17600   MENENIUS. Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
 17601     With modest warrant.
 17602   SICINIUS. Sir, how comes't that you
 17603     Have holp to make this rescue?
 17604   MENENIUS. Hear me speak.
 17605     As I do know the consul's worthiness,
 17606     So can I name his faults.
 17607   SICINIUS. Consul! What consul?
 17608   MENENIUS. The consul Coriolanus.
 17609   BRUTUS. He consul!
 17610   PLEBEIANS. No, no, no, no, no.
 17611   MENENIUS. If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
 17612     I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
 17613     The which shall turn you to no further harm
 17614     Than so much loss of time.
 17615   SICINIUS. Speak briefly, then,
 17616     For we are peremptory to dispatch
 17617     This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
 17618     Were but one danger, and to keep him here
 17619     Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
 17620     He dies to-night.
 17621   MENENIUS. Now the good gods forbid
 17622     That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
 17623     Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
 17624     In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
 17625     Should now eat up her own!
 17626   SICINIUS. He's a disease that must be cut away.
 17627   MENENIUS. O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
 17628     Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.
 17629     What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
 17630     Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-
 17631     Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
 17632     By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;
 17633     And what is left, to lose it by his country
 17634     Were to us all that do't and suffer it
 17635     A brand to th' end o' th' world.
 17636   SICINIUS. This is clean kam.
 17637   BRUTUS. Merely awry. When he did love his country,
 17638     It honour'd him.
 17639   SICINIUS. The service of the foot,
 17640     Being once gangren'd, is not then respected
 17641     For what before it was.
 17642   BRUTUS. We'll hear no more.
 17643     Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
 17644     Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
 17645     Spread further.
 17646   MENENIUS. One word more, one word
 17647     This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
 17648     The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
 17649     Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,
 17650     Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,
 17651     And sack great Rome with Romans.
 17652   BRUTUS. If it were so-
 17653   SICINIUS. What do ye talk?
 17654     Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
 17655     Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!
 17656   MENENIUS. Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
 17657     Since 'a could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
 17658     In bolted language; meal and bran together
 17659     He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
 17660     I'll go to him and undertake to bring him
 17661     Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
 17662     In peace, to his utmost peril.
 17663   FIRST SENATOR. Noble Tribunes,
 17664     It is the humane way; the other course
 17665     Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
 17666     Unknown to the beginning.
 17667   SICINIUS. Noble Menenius,
 17668     Be you then as the people's officer.
 17669     Masters, lay down your weapons.
 17670   BRUTUS. Go not home.
 17671   SICINIUS. Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there;
 17672     Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
 17673     In our first way.
 17674   MENENIUS. I'll bring him to you.
 17675     [To the SENATORS]  Let me desire your company; he must come,
 17676     Or what is worst will follow.
 17677   FIRST SENATOR. Pray you let's to him.                   Exeunt
 17678

 17682 SCENE II.
 17683 Rome. The house of CORIOLANUS
 17684 
 17685 Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES
 17686 
 17687   CORIOLANUS. Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
 17688     Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels;
 17689     Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
 17690     That the precipitation might down stretch
 17691     Below the beam of sight; yet will I still
 17692     Be thus to them.
 17693   FIRST PATRICIAN. You do the nobler.
 17694   CORIOLANUS. I muse my mother
 17695     Does not approve me further, who was wont
 17696     To call them woollen vassals, things created
 17697     To buy and sell with groats; to show bare heads
 17698     In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,
 17699     When one but of my ordinance stood up
 17700     To speak of peace or war.
 17701 
 17702                           Enter VOLUMNIA
 17703 
 17704     I talk of you:
 17705     Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me
 17706     False to my nature? Rather say I play
 17707     The man I am.
 17708   VOLUMNIA. O, sir, sir, sir,
 17709     I would have had you put your power well on
 17710     Before you had worn it out.
 17711   CORIOLANUS. Let go.
 17712   VOLUMNIA. You might have been enough the man you are
 17713     With striving less to be so; lesser had been
 17714     The thwartings of your dispositions, if
 17715     You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd,
 17716     Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
 17717   CORIOLANUS. Let them hang.
 17718   VOLUMNIA. Ay, and burn too.
 17719 
 17720                     Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS
 17721 
 17722   MENENIUS. Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough;
 17723     You must return and mend it.
 17724   FIRST SENATOR. There's no remedy,
 17725     Unless, by not so doing, our good city
 17726     Cleave in the midst and perish.
 17727   VOLUMNIA. Pray be counsell'd;
 17728     I have a heart as little apt as yours,
 17729     But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
 17730     To better vantage.
 17731   MENENIUS. Well said, noble woman!
 17732     Before he should thus stoop to th' herd, but that
 17733     The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic
 17734     For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
 17735     Which I can scarcely bear.
 17736   CORIOLANUS. What must I do?
 17737   MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes.
 17738   CORIOLANUS. Well, what then, what then?
 17739   MENENIUS. Repent what you have spoke.
 17740   CORIOLANUS. For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
 17741     Must I then do't to them?
 17742   VOLUMNIA. You are too absolute;
 17743     Though therein you can never be too noble
 17744     But when extremities speak. I have heard you say
 17745     Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
 17746     I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me
 17747     In peace what each of them by th' other lose
 17748     That they combine not there.
 17749   CORIOLANUS. Tush, tush!
 17750   MENENIUS. A good demand.
 17751   VOLUMNIA. If it be honour in your wars to seem
 17752     The same you are not, which for your best ends
 17753     You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse
 17754     That it shall hold companionship in peace
 17755     With honour as in war; since that to both
 17756     It stands in like request?
 17757   CORIOLANUS. Why force you this?
 17758   VOLUMNIA. Because that now it lies you on to speak
 17759     To th' people, not by your own instruction,
 17760     Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you,
 17761     But with such words that are but roted in
 17762     Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
 17763     Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
 17764     Now, this no more dishonours you at all
 17765     Than to take in a town with gentle words,
 17766     Which else would put you to your fortune and
 17767     The hazard of much blood.
 17768     I would dissemble with my nature where
 17769     My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
 17770     I should do so in honour. I am in this
 17771     Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
 17772     And you will rather show our general louts
 17773     How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon 'em
 17774     For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
 17775     Of what that want might ruin.
 17776   MENENIUS. Noble lady!
 17777     Come, go with us, speak fair; you may salve so,
 17778     Not what is dangerous present, but the los
 17779     Of what is past.
 17780   VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, My son,
 17781     Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand;
 17782     And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them-
 17783     Thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines
 17784     Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
 17785     More learned than the ears- waving thy head,
 17786     Which often thus correcting thy-stout heart,
 17787     Now humble as the ripest mulberry
 17788     That will not hold the handling. Or say to them
 17789     Thou art their soldier and, being bred in broils,
 17790     Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
 17791     Were fit for thee to use, as they to claim,
 17792     In asking their good loves; but thou wilt frame
 17793     Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
 17794     As thou hast power and person.
 17795   MENENIUS. This but done
 17796     Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
 17797     For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
 17798     As words to little purpose.
 17799   VOLUMNIA. Prithee now,
 17800     Go, and be rul'd; although I know thou hadst rather
 17801     Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
 17802     Than flatter him in a bower.
 17803 
 17804                            Enter COMINIUS
 17805 
 17806     Here is Cominius.
 17807   COMINIUS. I have been i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit
 17808     You make strong party, or defend yourself
 17809     By calmness or by absence; all's in anger.
 17810   MENENIUS. Only fair speech.
 17811   COMINIUS. I think 'twill serve, if he
 17812     Can thereto frame his spirit.
 17813   VOLUMNIA. He must and will.
 17814     Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
 17815   CORIOLANUS. Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce? Must I
 17816     With my base tongue give to my noble heart
 17817     A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
 17818     Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
 17819     This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it,
 17820     And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place!
 17821     You have put me now to such a part which never
 17822     I shall discharge to th' life.
 17823   COMINIUS. Come, come, we'll prompt you.
 17824   VOLUMNIA. I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
 17825     My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
 17826     To have my praise for this, perform a part
 17827     Thou hast not done before.
 17828   CORIOLANUS. Well, I must do't.
 17829     Away, my disposition, and possess me
 17830     Some harlot's spirit! My throat of war be turn'd,
 17831     Which quier'd with my drum, into a pipe
 17832     Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
 17833     That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves
 17834     Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
 17835     The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue
 17836     Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
 17837     Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
 17838     That hath receiv'd an alms! I will not do't,
 17839     Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth,
 17840     And by my body's action teach my mind
 17841     A most inherent baseness.
 17842   VOLUMNIA. At thy choice, then.
 17843     To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
 17844     Than thou of them. Come all to ruin. Let
 17845     Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
 17846     Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death
 17847     With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.
 17848     Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me;
 17849     But owe thy pride thyself.
 17850   CORIOLANUS. Pray be content.
 17851     Mother, I am going to the market-place;
 17852     Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
 17853     Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov'd
 17854     Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.
 17855     Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,
 17856     Or never trust to what my tongue can do
 17857     I' th' way of flattery further.
 17858   VOLUMNIA. Do your will.                                   Exit
 17859   COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself
 17860     To answer mildly; for they are prepar'd
 17861     With accusations, as I hear, more strong
 17862     Than are upon you yet.
 17863   CORIOLANUS. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go.
 17864     Let them accuse me by invention; I
 17865     Will answer in mine honour.
 17866   MENENIUS. Ay, but mildly.
 17867   CORIOLANUS. Well, mildly be it then- mildly.            Exeunt
 17868 
 17869 
 17870 
 17871 
 17872 SCENE III.
 17873 Rome. The Forum
 17874 
 17875 Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
 17876 
 17877   BRUTUS. In this point charge him home, that he affects
 17878     Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
 17879     Enforce him with his envy to the people,
 17880     And that the spoil got on the Antiates
 17881     Was ne'er distributed.
 17882 
 17883                            Enter an AEDILE
 17884 
 17885     What, will he come?
 17886   AEDILE. He's coming.
 17887   BRUTUS. How accompanied?
 17888   AEDILE. With old Menenius, and those senators
 17889     That always favour'd him.
 17890   SICINIUS. Have you a catalogue
 17891     Of all the voices that we have procur'd,
 17892     Set down by th' poll?
 17893   AEDILE. I have; 'tis ready.
 17894   SICINIUS. Have you corrected them by tribes?
 17895   AEDILE. I have.
 17896   SICINIUS. Assemble presently the people hither;
 17897     And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
 17898     I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either
 17899     For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
 17900     If I say fine, cry 'Fine!'- if death, cry 'Death!'
 17901     Insisting on the old prerogative
 17902     And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.
 17903   AEDILE. I shall inform them.
 17904   BRUTUS. And when such time they have begun to cry,
 17905     Let them not cease, but with a din confus'd
 17906     Enforce the present execution
 17907     Of what we chance to sentence.
 17908   AEDILE. Very well.
 17909   SICINIUS. Make them be strong, and ready for this hint,
 17910     When we shall hap to give't them.
 17911   BRUTUS. Go about it.                               Exit AEDILE
 17912     Put him to choler straight. He hath been us'd
 17913     Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
 17914     Of contradiction; being once chaf'd, he cannot
 17915     Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
 17916     What's in his heart, and that is there which looks
 17917     With us to break his neck.
 17918 
 17919           Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS and COMINIUS, with others
 17920 
 17921   SICINIUS. Well, here he comes.
 17922   MENENIUS. Calmly, I do beseech you.
 17923   CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for th' poorest piece
 17924     Will bear the knave by th' volume. Th' honour'd gods
 17925     Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
 17926     Supplied with worthy men! plant love among's!
 17927     Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
 17928     And not our streets with war!
 17929   FIRST SENATOR. Amen, amen!
 17930   MENENIUS. A noble wish.
 17931 
 17932                   Re-enter the.AEDILE,with the plebeians
 17933 
 17934   SICINIUS. Draw near, ye people.
 17935   AEDILE. List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say!
 17936   CORIOLANUS. First, hear me speak.
 17937   BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, say. Peace, ho!
 17938   CORIOLANUS. Shall I be charg'd no further than this present?
 17939     Must all determine here?
 17940   SICINIUS. I do demand,
 17941     If you submit you to the people's voices,
 17942     Allow their officers, and are content
 17943     To suffer lawful censure for such faults
 17944     As shall be prov'd upon you.
 17945   CORIOLANUS. I am content.
 17946   MENENIUS. Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
 17947     The warlike service he has done, consider; think
 17948     Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
 17949     Like graves i' th' holy churchyard.
 17950   CORIOLANUS. Scratches with briers,
 17951     Scars to move laughter only.
 17952   MENENIUS. Consider further,
 17953     That when he speaks not like a citizen,
 17954     You find him like a soldier; do not take
 17955     His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
 17956     But, as I say, such as become a soldier
 17957     Rather than envy you.
 17958   COMINIUS. Well, well! No more.
 17959   CORIOLANUS. What is the matter,
 17960     That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
 17961     I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
 17962     You take it off again?
 17963   SICINIUS. Answer to us.
 17964   CORIOLANUS. Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.
 17965   SICINIUS. We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
 17966     From Rome all season'd office, and to wind
 17967     Yourself into a power tyrannical;
 17968     For which you are a traitor to the people.
 17969   CORIOLANUS. How- traitor?
 17970   MENENIUS. Nay, temperately! Your promise.
 17971   CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people!
 17972     Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
 17973     Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
 17974     In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in
 17975     Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
 17976     'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
 17977     As I do pray the gods.
 17978   SICINIUS. Mark you this, people?
 17979   PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!
 17980   SICINIUS. Peace!
 17981     We need not put new matter to his charge.
 17982     What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
 17983     Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
 17984     Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
 17985     Those whose great power must try him- even this,
 17986     So criminal and in such capital kind,
 17987     Deserves th' extremest death.
 17988   BRUTUS. But since he hath
 17989     Serv'd well for Rome-
 17990   CORIOLANUS. What do you prate of service?
 17991   BRUTUS. I talk of that that know it.
 17992   CORIOLANUS. You!
 17993   MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother?
 17994   COMINIUS. Know, I pray you-
 17995   CORIOLANUS. I'll know no further.
 17996     Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
 17997     Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
 17998     But with a grain a day, I would not buy
 17999     Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
 18000     Nor check my courage for what they can give,
 18001     To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
 18002   SICINIUS. For that he has-
 18003     As much as in him lies- from time to time
 18004     Envied against the people, seeking means
 18005     To pluck away their power; as now at last
 18006     Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
 18007     Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
 18008     That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people,
 18009     And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
 18010     Ev'n from this instant, banish him our city,
 18011     In peril of precipitation
 18012     From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
 18013     To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name,
 18014     I say it shall be so.
 18015   PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so! Let him away!
 18016     He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
 18017   COMINIUS. Hear me, my masters and my common friends-
 18018   SICINIUS. He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
 18019   COMINIUS. Let me speak.
 18020     I have been consul, and can show for Rome
 18021     Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
 18022     My country's good with a respect more tender,
 18023     More holy and profound, than mine own life,
 18024     My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase
 18025     And treasure of my loins. Then if I would
 18026     Speak that-
 18027   SICINIUS. We know your drift. Speak what?
 18028   BRUTUS. There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
 18029     As enemy to the people and his country.
 18030     It shall be so.
 18031   PLEBEIANS. It shall be so, it shall be so.
 18032   CORIOLANUS. YOU common cry of curs, whose breath I hate
 18033     As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize
 18034     As the dead carcasses of unburied men
 18035     That do corrupt my air- I banish you.
 18036     And here remain with your uncertainty!
 18037     Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts;
 18038     Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
 18039     Fan you into despair! Have the power still
 18040     To banish your defenders, till at length
 18041     Your ignorance- which finds not till it feels,
 18042     Making but reservation of yourselves
 18043     Still your own foes- deliver you
 18044     As most abated captives to some nation
 18045     That won you without blows! Despising
 18046     For you the city, thus I turn my back;
 18047     There is a world elsewhere.
 18048                                               Exeunt CORIOLANUS,
 18049                    COMINIUS, MENENIUS, with the other PATRICIANS
 18050   AEDILE. The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
 18051                         [They all shout and throw up their caps]
 18052   PLEBEIANS. Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Hoo-oo!
 18053   SICINIUS. Go see him out at gates, and follow him,
 18054     As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
 18055     Give him deserv'd vexation. Let a guard
 18056     Attend us through the city.
 18057   PLEBEIANS. Come, come, let's see him out at gates; come!
 18058     The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.           Exeunt

 18074 ACT IV. SCENE I.
 18075 Rome. Before a gate of the city
 18076 
 18077 Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS,
 18078 with the young NOBILITY of Rome
 18079 
 18080   CORIOLANUS. Come, leave your tears; a brief farewell. The beast
 18081     With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
 18082     Where is your ancient courage? You were us'd
 18083     To say extremities was the trier of spirits;
 18084     That common chances common men could bear;
 18085     That when the sea was calm all boats alike
 18086     Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
 18087     When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves
 18088     A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
 18089     With precepts that would make invincible
 18090     The heart that conn'd them.
 18091   VIRGILIA. O heavens! O heavens!
 18092   CORIOLANUS. Nay, I prithee, woman-
 18093   VOLUMNIA. Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
 18094     And occupations perish!
 18095   CORIOLANUS. What, what, what!
 18096     I shall be lov'd when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,
 18097     Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,
 18098     If you had been the wife of Hercules,
 18099     Six of his labours you'd have done, and sav'd
 18100     Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
 18101     Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother.
 18102     I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
 18103     Thy tears are salter than a younger man's
 18104     And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime General,
 18105     I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
 18106     Heart-hard'ning spectacles; tell these sad women
 18107     'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
 18108     As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
 18109     My hazards still have been your solace; and
 18110     Believe't not lightly- though I go alone,
 18111     Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
 18112     Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen- your son
 18113     Will or exceed the common or be caught
 18114     With cautelous baits and practice.
 18115   VOLUMNIA. My first son,
 18116     Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
 18117     With thee awhile; determine on some course
 18118     More than a wild exposture to each chance
 18119     That starts i' th' way before thee.
 18120   VIRGILIA. O the gods!
 18121   COMINIUS. I'll follow thee a month, devise with the
 18122     Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us,
 18123     And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth
 18124     A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
 18125     O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
 18126     And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
 18127     I' th' absence of the needer.
 18128   CORIOLANUS. Fare ye well;
 18129     Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full
 18130     Of the wars' surfeits to go rove with one
 18131     That's yet unbruis'd; bring me but out at gate.
 18132     Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
 18133     My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,
 18134     Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you come.
 18135     While I remain above the ground you shall
 18136     Hear from me still, and never of me aught
 18137     But what is like me formerly.
 18138   MENENIUS. That's worthily
 18139     As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
 18140     If I could shake off but one seven years
 18141     From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
 18142     I'd with thee every foot.
 18143   CORIOLANUS. Give me thy hand.
 18144     Come.                                                 Exeunt
 18145 
 18146 
 18147 
 18148 
 18149 SCENE II.
 18150 Rome. A street near the gate
 18151 
 18152 Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS with the AEDILE
 18153 
 18154   SICINIUS. Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
 18155     The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
 18156     In his behalf.
 18157   BRUTUS. Now we have shown our power,
 18158     Let us seem humbler after it is done
 18159     Than when it was a-doing.
 18160   SICINIUS. Bid them home.
 18161     Say their great enemy is gone, and they
 18162     Stand in their ancient strength.
 18163   BRUTUS. Dismiss them home.                         Exit AEDILE
 18164     Here comes his mother.
 18165 
 18166                    Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS
 18167 
 18168   SICINIUS. Let's not meet her.
 18169   BRUTUS. Why?
 18170   SICINIUS. They say she's mad.
 18171   BRUTUS. They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.
 18172   VOLUMNIA. O, Y'are well met; th' hoarded plague o' th' gods
 18173     Requite your love!
 18174   MENENIUS. Peace, peace, be not so loud.
 18175   VOLUMNIA. If that I could for weeping, you should hear-
 18176     Nay, and you shall hear some.  [To BRUTUS] Will you be gone?
 18177   VIRGILIA.  [To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too. I would I had the
 18178       power
 18179     To say so to my husband.
 18180   SICINIUS. Are you mankind?
 18181   VOLUMNIA. Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this, fool:
 18182     Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
 18183     To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
 18184     Than thou hast spoken words?
 18185   SICINIUS. O blessed heavens!
 18186   VOLUMNIA. Moe noble blows than ever thou wise words;
 18187     And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what- yet go!
 18188     Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son
 18189     Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
 18190     His good sword in his hand.
 18191   SICINIUS. What then?
 18192   VIRGILIA. What then!
 18193     He'd make an end of thy posterity.
 18194   VOLUMNIA. Bastards and all.
 18195     Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
 18196   MENENIUS. Come, come, peace.
 18197   SICINIUS. I would he had continued to his country
 18198     As he began, and not unknit himself
 18199     The noble knot he made.
 18200   BRUTUS. I would he had.
 18201   VOLUMNIA. 'I would he had!' 'Twas you incens'd the rabble-
 18202     Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth
 18203     As I can of those mysteries which heaven
 18204     Will not have earth to know.
 18205   BRUTUS. Pray, let's go.
 18206   VOLUMNIA. Now, pray, sir, get you gone;
 18207     You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:
 18208     As far as doth the Capitol exceed
 18209     The meanest house in Rome, so far my son-
 18210     This lady's husband here, this, do you see?-
 18211     Whom you have banish'd does exceed you an.
 18212   BRUTUS. Well, well, we'll leave you.
 18213   SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited
 18214     With one that wants her wits?                Exeunt TRIBUNES
 18215   VOLUMNIA. Take my prayers with you.
 18216     I would the gods had nothing else to do
 18217     But to confirm my curses. Could I meet 'em
 18218     But once a day, it would unclog my heart
 18219     Of what lies heavy to't.
 18220   MENENIUS. You have told them home,
 18221     And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
 18222   VOLUMNIA. Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
 18223     And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.
 18224     Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
 18225     In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
 18226                                     Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA
 18227   MENENIUS. Fie, fie, fie!                                  Exit
 18228 
 18229 
 18230 
 18231 
 18232 SCENE III.
 18233 A highway between Rome and Antium
 18234 
 18235 Enter a ROMAN and a VOLSCE, meeting
 18236 
 18237   ROMAN. I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I think,
 18238     is Adrian.
 18239   VOLSCE. It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.
 18240   ROMAN. I am a Roman; and my services are, as you are, against 'em.
 18241     Know you me yet?
 18242   VOLSCE. Nicanor? No!
 18243   ROMAN. The same, sir.
 18244   VOLSCE. YOU had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is
 18245     well appear'd by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a
 18246     note from the Volscian state, to find you out there. You have
 18247     well saved me a day's journey.
 18248   ROMAN. There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people
 18249     against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
 18250   VOLSCE. Hath been! Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they
 18251     are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in
 18252     the heat of their division.
 18253   ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make
 18254     it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment
 18255     of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
 18256     all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes
 18257     for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature
 18258     for the violent breaking out.
 18259   VOLSCE. Coriolanus banish'd!
 18260   ROMAN. Banish'd, sir.
 18261   VOLSCE. You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
 18262   ROMAN. The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the
 18263     fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out
 18264     with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in
 18265     these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no
 18266     request of his country.
 18267   VOLSCE. He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to
 18268     encounter you; you have ended my business, and I will merrily
 18269     accompany you home.
 18270   ROMAN. I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things
 18271     from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you
 18272     an army ready, say you?
 18273   VOLSCE. A most royal one: the centurions and their charges,
 18274     distinctly billeted, already in th' entertainment, and to be on
 18275     foot at an hour's warning.
 18276   ROMAN. I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I
 18277     think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily
 18278     well met, and most glad of your company.
 18279   VOLSCE. You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be
 18280     glad of yours.
 18281   ROMAN. Well, let us go together.
 18282 
 18283 
 18284 
 18285 
 18286 SCENE IV.
 18287 Antium. Before AUFIDIUS' house
 18288 
 18289 Enter CORIOLANUS, in mean apparel, disguis'd and muffled
 18290 
 18291   CORIOLANUS. A goodly city is this Antium. City,
 18292     'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
 18293     Of these fair edifices fore my wars
 18294     Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not.
 18295     Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones,
 18296     In puny battle slay me.
 18297 
 18298                            Enter A CITIZEN
 18299 
 18300     Save you, sir.
 18301   CITIZEN. And you.
 18302   CORIOLANUS. Direct me, if it be your will,
 18303     Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?
 18304   CITIZEN. He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
 18305     At his house this night.
 18306   CORIOLANUS. Which is his house, beseech you?
 18307   CITIZEN. This here before you.
 18308   CORIOLANUS. Thank you, sir; farewell.             Exit CITIZEN
 18309     O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
 18310     Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart,
 18311     Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise
 18312     Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love,
 18313     Unseparable, shall within this hour,
 18314     On a dissension of a doit, break out
 18315     To bitterest enmity; so fellest foes,
 18316     Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
 18317     To take the one the other, by some chance,
 18318     Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
 18319     And interjoin their issues. So with me:
 18320     My birthplace hate I, and my love's upon
 18321     This enemy town. I'll enter. If he slay me,
 18322     He does fair justice: if he give me way,
 18323     I'll do his country service.
 18324 
 18325 
 18326 
 18327 
 18328 SCENE V.
 18329 Antium. AUFIDIUS' house
 18330 
 18331 Music plays. Enter A SERVINGMAN
 18332 
 18333   FIRST SERVANT. Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our
 18334     fellows are asleep.                                     Exit
 18335 
 18336                      Enter another SERVINGMAN
 18337 
 18338   SECOND SERVANT.Where's Cotus? My master calls for him.
 18339     Cotus!                                                  Exit
 18340 
 18341                        Enter CORIOLANUS
 18342 
 18343   CORIOLANUS. A goodly house. The feast smells well, but I
 18344     Appear not like a guest.
 18345 
 18346                  Re-enter the first SERVINGMAN
 18347 
 18348   FIRST SERVANT. What would you have, friend?
 18349     Whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray go to the door.
 18350  Exit
 18351   CORIOLANUS. I have deserv'd no better entertainment
 18352     In being Coriolanus.
 18353 
 18354                    Re-enter second SERVINGMAN
 18355 
 18356   SECOND SERVANT. Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
 18357     head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out.
 18358   CORIOLANUS. Away!
 18359   SECOND SERVANT. Away? Get you away.
 18360   CORIOLANUS. Now th' art troublesome.
 18361   SECOND SERVANT. Are you so brave? I'll have you talk'd with anon.
 18362 
 18363           Enter a third SERVINGMAN. The first meets him
 18364 
 18365   THIRD SERVANT. What fellow's this?
 18366   FIRST SERVANT. A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him
 18367     out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.
 18368   THIRD SERVANT. What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you avoid the
 18369     house.
 18370   CORIOLANUS. Let me but stand- I will not hurt your hearth.
 18371   THIRD SERVANT. What are you?
 18372   CORIOLANUS. A gentleman.
 18373   THIRD SERVANT. A marv'llous poor one.
 18374   CORIOLANUS. True, so I am.
 18375   THIRD SERVANT. Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
 18376     station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid. Come.
 18377   CORIOLANUS. Follow your function, go and batten on cold bits.
 18378                                       [Pushes him away from him]
 18379   THIRD SERVANT. What, you will not? Prithee tell my master what a
 18380     strange guest he has here.
 18381   SECOND SERVANT. And I shall.                              Exit
 18382   THIRD SERVANT. Where dwell'st thou?
 18383   CORIOLANUS. Under the canopy.
 18384   THIRD SERVANT. Under the canopy?
 18385   CORIOLANUS. Ay.
 18386   THIRD SERVANT. Where's that?
 18387   CORIOLANUS. I' th' city of kites and crows.
 18388   THIRD SERVANT. I' th' city of kites and crows!
 18389     What an ass it is! Then thou dwell'st with daws too?
 18390   CORIOLANUS. No, I serve not thy master.
 18391   THIRD SERVANT. How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?
 18392   CORIOLANUS. Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
 18393     mistress. Thou prat'st and prat'st; serve with thy trencher;
 18394     hence!                                      [Beats him away]
 18395 
 18396              Enter AUFIDIUS with the second SERVINGMAN
 18397 
 18398   AUFIDIUS. Where is this fellow?
 18399   SECOND SERVANT. Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for
 18400     disturbing the lords within.
 18401   AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?
 18402     Why speak'st not? Speak, man. What's thy name?
 18403   CORIOLANUS.  [Unmuffling]  If, Tullus,
 18404     Not yet thou know'st me, and, seeing me, dost not
 18405     Think me for the man I am, necessity
 18406     Commands me name myself.
 18407   AUFIDIUS. What is thy name?
 18408   CORIOLANUS. A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
 18409     And harsh in sound to thine.
 18410   AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name?
 18411     Thou has a grim appearance, and thy face
 18412     Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn,
 18413     Thou show'st a noble vessel. What's thy name?
 18414   CORIOLANUS. Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet?
 18415   AUFIDIUS. I know thee not. Thy name?
 18416   CORIOLANUS. My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
 18417     To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,
 18418     Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
 18419     My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,
 18420     The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
 18421     Shed for my thankless country, are requited
 18422     But with that surname- a good memory
 18423     And witness of the malice and displeasure
 18424     Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;
 18425     The cruelty and envy of the people,
 18426     Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
 18427     Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,
 18428     An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
 18429     Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
 18430     Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,
 18431     Mistake me not, to save my life; for if
 18432     I had fear'd death, of all the men i' th' world
 18433     I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
 18434     To be full quit of those my banishers,
 18435     Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
 18436     A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
 18437     Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
 18438     Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight
 18439     And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
 18440     That my revengeful services may prove
 18441     As benefits to thee; for I will fight
 18442     Against my cank'red country with the spleen
 18443     Of all the under fiends. But if so be
 18444     Thou dar'st not this, and that to prove more fortunes
 18445     Th'art tir'd, then, in a word, I also am
 18446     Longer to live most weary, and present
 18447     My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
 18448     Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
 18449     Since I have ever followed thee with hate,
 18450     Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
 18451     And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
 18452     It be to do thee service.
 18453   AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius!
 18454     Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
 18455     A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
 18456     Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
 18457     And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
 18458     Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
 18459     Mine arms about that body, where against
 18460     My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
 18461     And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
 18462     The anvil of my sword, and do contest
 18463     As hotly and as nobly with thy love
 18464     As ever in ambitious strength I did
 18465     Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
 18466     I lov'd the maid I married; never man
 18467     Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
 18468     Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart
 18469     Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
 18470     Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell the
 18471     We have a power on foot, and I had purpose
 18472     Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
 18473     Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out
 18474     Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
 18475     Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me-
 18476     We have been down together in my sleep,
 18477     Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat-
 18478     And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
 18479     Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
 18480     Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
 18481     From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
 18482     Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
 18483     Like a bold flood o'erbeat. O, come, go in,
 18484     And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
 18485     Who now are here, taking their leaves of me
 18486     Who am prepar'd against your territories,
 18487     Though not for Rome itself.
 18488   CORIOLANUS. You bless me, gods!
 18489   AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have
 18490     The leading of thine own revenges, take
 18491     Th' one half of my commission, and set down-
 18492     As best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st
 18493     Thy country's strength and weakness- thine own ways,
 18494     Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
 18495     Or rudely visit them in parts remote
 18496     To fright them ere destroy. But come in;
 18497     Let me commend thee first to those that shall
 18498     Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
 18499     And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
 18500     Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand; most welcome!
 18501                                   Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
 18502 
 18503                     The two SERVINGMEN come forward
 18504 
 18505   FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration!
 18506   SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
 18507     a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
 18508     of him.
 18509   FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his
 18510     finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
 18511   SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
 18512     him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to
 18513     term it.
 18514   FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,
 18515     but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
 18516   SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest
 18517     man i' th' world.
 18518   FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot
 18519     on.
 18520   SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master?
 18521   FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no matter for that.
 18522   SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him.
 18523   FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the
 18524     greater soldier.
 18525   SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that;
 18526     for the defence of a town our general is excellent.
 18527   FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too.
 18528 
 18529                        Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN
 18530 
 18531   THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals!
 18532   BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake.
 18533   THIRD SERVANT. I would not be a Roman, of all nations;
 18534     I had as lief be a condemn'd man.
 18535   BOTH. Wherefore? wherefore?
 18536   THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general-
 18537     Caius Marcius.
 18538   FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our general'?
 18539   THIRD SERVANT. I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always
 18540     good enough for him.
 18541   SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too
 18542     hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.
 18543   FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
 18544     on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
 18545     carbonado.
 18546   SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally given, he might have
 18547     broil'd and eaten him too.
 18548   FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news!
 18549   THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son
 18550     and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question
 18551     asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him.
 18552     Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself
 18553     with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse.
 18554     But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle
 18555     and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half
 18556     by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
 18557     and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all
 18558     down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.
 18559   SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
 18560   THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as
 18561     many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst
 18562     not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,
 18563     whilst he's in directitude.
 18564   FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that?
 18565   THIRD SERVANT. But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and
 18566     the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies
 18567     after rain, and revel an with him.
 18568   FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward?
 18569   THIRD SERVANT. To-morrow, to-day, presently. You shall have the
 18570     drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their
 18571     feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.
 18572   SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
 18573     This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and
 18574     breed ballad-makers.
 18575   FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
 18576     day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.
 18577     Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy,
 18578     insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a
 18579     destroyer of men.
 18580   SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be
 18581     a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
 18582     cuckolds.
 18583   FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
 18584   THIRD SERVANT. Reason: because they then less need one another. The
 18585     wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.
 18586     They are rising, they are rising.
 18587   BOTH. In, in, in, in!                                   Exeunt
 18588 
 18589 
 18590 
 18591 
 18592 SCENE VI.
 18593 Rome. A public place
 18594 
 18595 Enter the two Tribunes, SICINIUS and BRUTUS
 18596 
 18597   SICINIUS. We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.
 18598     His remedies are tame. The present peace
 18599     And quietness of the people, which before
 18600     Were in wild hurry, here do make his friends
 18601     Blush that the world goes well; who rather had,
 18602     Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
 18603     Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see
 18604     Our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
 18605     About their functions friendly.
 18606 
 18607                           Enter MENENIUS
 18608 
 18609   BRUTUS. We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?
 18610   SICINIUS. 'Tis he, 'tis he. O, he is grown most kind
 18611     Of late. Hail, sir!
 18612   MENENIUS. Hail to you both!
 18613   SICINIUS. Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd
 18614     But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand,
 18615     And so would do, were he more angry at it.
 18616   MENENIUS. All's well, and might have been much better
 18617     He could have temporiz'd.
 18618   SICINIUS. Where is he, hear you?
 18619   MENENIUS. Nay, I hear nothing; his mother and his wife
 18620     Hear nothing from him.
 18621 
 18622                      Enter three or four citizens
 18623 
 18624   CITIZENS. The gods preserve you both!
 18625   SICINIUS. God-den, our neighbours.
 18626   BRUTUS. God-den to you all, god-den to you an.
 18627   FIRST CITIZEN. Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees
 18628     Are bound to pray for you both.
 18629   SICINIUS. Live and thrive!
 18630   BRUTUS. Farewell, kind neighbours; we wish'd Coriolanus
 18631     Had lov'd you as we did.
 18632   CITIZENS. Now the gods keep you!
 18633   BOTH TRIBUNES. Farewell, farewell.             Exeunt citizens
 18634   SICINIUS. This is a happier and more comely time
 18635     Than when these fellows ran about the streets
 18636     Crying confusion.
 18637   BRUTUS. Caius Marcius was
 18638     A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
 18639     O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
 18640     Self-loving-
 18641   SICINIUS. And affecting one sole throne,
 18642     Without assistance.
 18643   MENENIUS. I think not so.
 18644   SICINIUS. We should by this, to all our lamentation,
 18645     If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
 18646   BRUTUS. The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
 18647     Sits safe and still without him.
 18648 
 18649                              Enter an AEDILE
 18650 
 18651   AEDILE. Worthy tribunes,
 18652     There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
 18653     Reports the Volsces with several powers
 18654     Are ent'red in the Roman territories,
 18655     And with the deepest malice of the war
 18656     Destroy what lies before 'em.
 18657   MENENIUS. 'Tis Aufidius,
 18658     Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
 18659     Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,
 18660     Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
 18661     And durst not once peep out.
 18662   SICINIUS. Come, what talk you of Marcius?
 18663   BRUTUS. Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
 18664     The Volsces dare break with us.
 18665   MENENIUS. Cannot be!
 18666     We have record that very well it can;
 18667     And three examples of the like hath been
 18668     Within my age. But reason with the fellow
 18669     Before you punish him, where he heard this,
 18670     Lest you shall chance to whip your information
 18671     And beat the messenger who bids beware
 18672     Of what is to be dreaded.
 18673   SICINIUS. Tell not me.
 18674     I know this cannot be.
 18675   BRUTUS. Not Possible.
 18676 
 18677                            Enter A MESSENGER
 18678 
 18679   MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going
 18680     All to the Senate House; some news is come
 18681     That turns their countenances.
 18682   SICINIUS. 'Tis this slave-
 18683     Go whip him fore the people's eyes- his raising,
 18684     Nothing but his report.
 18685   MESSENGER. Yes, worthy sir,
 18686     The slave's report is seconded, and more,
 18687     More fearful, is deliver'd.
 18688   SICINIUS. What more fearful?
 18689   MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouths-
 18690     How probable I do not know- that Marcius,
 18691     Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
 18692     And vows revenge as spacious as between
 18693     The young'st and oldest thing.
 18694   SICINIUS. This is most likely!
 18695   BRUTUS. Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
 18696     Good Marcius home again.
 18697   SICINIUS. The very trick on 't.
 18698   MENENIUS. This is unlikely.
 18699     He and Aufidius can no more atone
 18700     Than violent'st contrariety.
 18701 
 18702                       Enter a second MESSENGER
 18703 
 18704   SECOND MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Senate.
 18705     A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
 18706     Associated with Aufidius, rages
 18707     Upon our territories, and have already
 18708     O'erborne their way, consum'd with fire and took
 18709     What lay before them.
 18710 
 18711                             Enter COMINIUS
 18712 
 18713   COMINIUS. O, you have made good work!
 18714   MENENIUS. What news? what news?
 18715   COMINIUS. You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
 18716     To melt the city leads upon your pates,
 18717     To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses-
 18718   MENENIUS. What's the news? What's the news?
 18719   COMINIUS. Your temples burned in their cement, and
 18720     Your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd
 18721     Into an auger's bore.
 18722   MENENIUS. Pray now, your news?
 18723     You have made fair work, I fear me. Pray, your news.
 18724     If Marcius should be join'd wi' th' Volscians-
 18725   COMINIUS. If!
 18726     He is their god; he leads them like a thing
 18727     Made by some other deity than Nature,
 18728     That shapes man better; and they follow him
 18729     Against us brats with no less confidence
 18730     Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
 18731     Or butchers killing flies.
 18732   MENENIUS. You have made good work,
 18733     You and your apron men; you that stood so much
 18734     Upon the voice of occupation and
 18735     The breath of garlic-eaters!
 18736   COMINIUS. He'll shake
 18737     Your Rome about your ears.
 18738   MENENIUS. As Hercules
 18739     Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work!
 18740   BRUTUS. But is this true, sir?
 18741   COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale
 18742     Before you find it other. All the regions
 18743     Do smilingly revolt, and who resists
 18744     Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
 18745     And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
 18746     Your enemies and his find something in him.
 18747   MENENIUS. We are all undone unless
 18748     The noble man have mercy.
 18749   COMINIUS. Who shall ask it?
 18750     The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
 18751     Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
 18752     Does of the shepherds; for his best friends, if they
 18753     Should say 'Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even
 18754     As those should do that had deserv'd his hate,
 18755     And therein show'd fike enemies.
 18756   MENENIUS. 'Tis true;
 18757     If he were putting to my house the brand
 18758     That should consume it, I have not the face
 18759     To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
 18760     You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!
 18761   COMINIUS. You have brought
 18762     A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
 18763     S' incapable of help.
 18764   BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we brought it.
 18765   MENENIUS. How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts
 18766     And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
 18767     Who did hoot him out o' th' city.
 18768   COMINIUS. But I fear
 18769     They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
 18770     The second name of men, obeys his points
 18771     As if he were his officer. Desperation
 18772     Is all the policy, strength, and defence,
 18773     That Rome can make against them.
 18774 
 18775                        Enter a troop of citizens
 18776 
 18777   MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters.
 18778     And is Aufidius with him? You are they
 18779     That made the air unwholesome when you cast
 18780     Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
 18781     Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming,
 18782     And not a hair upon a soldier's head
 18783     Which will not prove a whip; as many coxcombs
 18784     As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
 18785     And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
 18786     If he could burn us all into one coal
 18787     We have deserv'd it.
 18788   PLEBEIANS. Faith, we hear fearful news.
 18789   FIRST CITIZEN. For mine own part,
 18790     When I said banish him, I said 'twas pity.
 18791   SECOND CITIZEN. And so did I.
 18792   THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
 18793     many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we
 18794     willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our
 18795     will.
 18796   COMINIUS. Y'are goodly things, you voices!
 18797   MENENIUS. You have made
 18798     Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
 18799   COMINIUS. O, ay, what else?
 18800                                     Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
 18801   SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
 18802     These are a side that would be glad to have
 18803     This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
 18804     And show no sign of fear.
 18805   FIRST CITIZEN. The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. I
 18806     ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him.
 18807   SECOND CITIZEN. So did we all. But come, let's home.
 18808                                                  Exeunt citizens
 18809   BRUTUS. I do not like this news.
 18810   SICINIUS. Nor I.
 18811   BRUTUS. Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
 18812     Would buy this for a lie!
 18813   SICINIUS. Pray let's go.                                Exeunt
 18814 
 18815 
 18816 
 18817 
 18818 SCENE VII.
 18819 A camp at a short distance from Rome
 18820 
 18821 Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT
 18822 
 18823   AUFIDIUS. Do they still fly to th' Roman?
 18824   LIEUTENANT. I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
 18825     Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,
 18826     Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
 18827     And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
 18828     Even by your own.
 18829   AUFIDIUS. I cannot help it now,
 18830     Unless by using means I lame the foot
 18831     Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
 18832     Even to my person, than I thought he would
 18833     When first I did embrace him; yet his nature
 18834     In that's no changeling, and I must excuse
 18835     What cannot be amended.
 18836   LIEUTENANT. Yet I wish, sir-
 18837     I mean, for your particular- you had not
 18838     Join'd in commission with him, but either
 18839     Had borne the action of yourself, or else
 18840     To him had left it solely.
 18841   AUFIDIUS. I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
 18842     When he shall come to his account, he knows not
 18843     What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
 18844     And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
 18845     To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly
 18846     And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
 18847     Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
 18848     As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
 18849     That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
 18850     Whene'er we come to our account.
 18851   LIEUTENANT. Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
 18852   AUFIDIUS. All places yield to him ere he sits down,
 18853     And the nobility of Rome are his;
 18854     The senators and patricians love him too.
 18855     The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
 18856     Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
 18857     To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
 18858     As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
 18859     By sovereignty of nature. First he was
 18860     A noble servant to them, but he could not
 18861     Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,
 18862     Which out of daily fortune ever taints
 18863     The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
 18864     To fail in the disposing of those chances
 18865     Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
 18866     Not to be other than one thing, not moving
 18867     From th' casque to th' cushion, but commanding peace
 18868     Even with the same austerity and garb
 18869     As he controll'd the war; but one of these-
 18870     As he hath spices of them all- not all,
 18871     For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,
 18872     So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit
 18873     To choke it in the utt'rance. So our virtues
 18874     Lie in th' interpretation of the time;
 18875     And power, unto itself most commendable,
 18876     Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
 18877     T' extol what it hath done.
 18878     One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
 18879     Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
 18880     Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
 18881     Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
 18882                                                           Exeunt

 18898 ACT V. SCENE I.
 18899 Rome. A public place
 18900 
 18901 Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS and BRUTUS, the two Tribunes, with others
 18902 
 18903   MENENIUS. No, I'll not go. You hear what he hath said
 18904     Which was sometime his general, who lov'd him
 18905     In a most dear particular. He call'd me father;
 18906     But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him:
 18907     A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
 18908     The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy'd
 18909     To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
 18910   COMINIUS. He would not seem to know me.
 18911   MENENIUS. Do you hear?
 18912   COMINIUS. Yet one time he did call me by my name.
 18913     I urg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
 18914     That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus'
 18915     He would not answer to; forbid all names;
 18916     He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
 18917     Till he had forg'd himself a name i' th' fire
 18918     Of burning Rome.
 18919   MENENIUS. Why, so! You have made good work.
 18920     A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
 18921     To make coals cheap- a noble memory!
 18922   COMINIUS. I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
 18923     When it was less expected; he replied,
 18924     It was a bare petition of a state
 18925     To one whom they had punish'd.
 18926   MENENIUS. Very well.
 18927     Could he say less?
 18928   COMINIUS. I offer'd to awaken his regard
 18929     For's private friends; his answer to me was,
 18930     He could not stay to pick them in a pile
 18931     Of noisome musty chaff. He said 'twas folly,
 18932     For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt
 18933     And still to nose th' offence.
 18934   MENENIUS. For one poor grain or two!
 18935     I am one of those. His mother, wife, his child,
 18936     And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
 18937     You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
 18938     Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.
 18939   SICINIUS. Nay, pray be patient; if you refuse your aid
 18940     In this so never-needed help, yet do not
 18941     Upbraid's with our distress. But sure, if you
 18942     Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
 18943     More than the instant army we can make,
 18944     Might stop our countryman.
 18945   MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle.
 18946   SICINIUS. Pray you go to him.
 18947   MENENIUS. What should I do?
 18948   BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do
 18949     For Rome, towards Marcius.
 18950   MENENIUS. Well, and say that Marcius
 18951     Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
 18952     Unheard- what then?
 18953     But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
 18954     With his unkindness? Say't be so?
 18955   SICINIUS. Yet your good will
 18956     Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
 18957     As you intended well.
 18958   MENENIUS. I'll undertake't;
 18959     I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip
 18960     And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
 18961     He was not taken well: he had not din'd;
 18962     The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
 18963     We pout upon the morning, are unapt
 18964     To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
 18965     These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
 18966     With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
 18967     Than in our priest-like fasts. Therefore I'll watch him
 18968     Till he be dieted to my request,
 18969     And then I'll set upon him.
 18970   BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindness
 18971     And cannot lose your way.
 18972   MENENIUS. Good faith, I'll prove him,
 18973     Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
 18974     Of my success.                                          Exit
 18975   COMINIUS. He'll never hear him.
 18976   SICINIUS. Not?
 18977   COMINIUS. I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye
 18978     Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury
 18979     The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
 18980     'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
 18981     Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do,
 18982     He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
 18983     Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions;
 18984     So that all hope is vain,
 18985     Unless his noble mother and his wife,
 18986     Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
 18987     For mercy to his country. Therefore let's hence,
 18988     And with our fair entreaties haste them on.           Exeunt
 18989 
 18990 
 18991 
 18992 
 18993 SCENE II.
 18994 The Volscian camp before Rome
 18995 
 18996 Enter MENENIUS to the WATCH on guard
 18997 
 18998   FIRST WATCH. Stay. Whence are you?
 18999   SECOND WATCH. Stand, and go back.
 19000   MENENIUS. You guard like men, 'tis well; but, by your leave,
 19001     I am an officer of state and come
 19002     To speak with Coriolanus.
 19003   FIRST WATCH. From whence?
 19004   MENENIUS. From Rome.
 19005   FIRST WATCH. YOU may not pass; you must return. Our general
 19006     Will no more hear from thence.
 19007   SECOND WATCH. You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before
 19008     You'll speak with Coriolanus.
 19009   MENENIUS. Good my friends,
 19010     If you have heard your general talk of Rome
 19011     And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
 19012     My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.
 19013   FIRST WATCH. Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name
 19014     Is not here passable.
 19015   MENENIUS. I tell thee, fellow,
 19016     Thy general is my lover. I have been
 19017     The book of his good acts whence men have read
 19018     His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;
 19019     For I have ever verified my friends-
 19020     Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity
 19021     Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,
 19022     Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
 19023     I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise
 19024     Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fellow,
 19025     I must have leave to pass.
 19026   FIRST WATCH. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf
 19027     as you have uttered words in your own, you should not pass here;
 19028     no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely.
 19029     Therefore go back.
 19030   MENENIUS. Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always
 19031     factionary on the party of your general.
 19032   SECOND WATCH. Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
 19033     have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot
 19034     pass. Therefore go back.
 19035   MENENIUS. Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with
 19036     him till after dinner.
 19037   FIRST WATCH. You are a Roman, are you?
 19038   MENENIUS. I am as thy general is.
 19039   FIRST WATCH. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when
 19040     you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in
 19041     a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think
 19042     to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the
 19043     virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied
 19044     intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you
 19045     think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
 19046     in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore
 19047     back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd;
 19048     our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.
 19049   MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me
 19050     with estimation.
 19051   FIRST WATCH. Come, my captain knows you not.
 19052   MENENIUS. I mean thy general.
 19053   FIRST WATCH. My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I
 19054     let forth your half pint of blood. Back- that's the utmost of
 19055     your having. Back.
 19056   MENENIUS. Nay, but fellow, fellow-
 19057 
 19058                       Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS
 19059 
 19060   CORIOLANUS. What's the matter?
 19061   MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall
 19062     know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack
 19063     guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my
 19064     entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i' th' state of
 19065     hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller
 19066     in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come
 19067     upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
 19068     particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father
 19069     Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;
 19070     look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come
 19071     to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I
 19072     have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to
 19073     pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage
 19074     thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,
 19075     who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.
 19076   CORIOLANUS. Away!
 19077   MENENIUS. How! away!
 19078   CORIOLANUS. Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
 19079     Are servanted to others. Though I owe
 19080     My revenge properly, my remission lies
 19081     In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
 19082     Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
 19083     Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.
 19084     Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
 19085     Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,
 19086     Take this along; I writ it for thy sake     [Gives a letter]
 19087     And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,
 19088     I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
 19089     Was my belov'd in Rome; yet thou behold'st.
 19090   AUFIDIUS. You keep a constant temper.
 19091                                   Exeunt CORIOLANUS and Aufidius
 19092   FIRST WATCH. Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
 19093   SECOND WATCH. 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the
 19094     way home again.
 19095   FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
 19096     greatness back?
 19097   SECOND WATCH. What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
 19098   MENENIUS. I neither care for th' world nor your general; for such
 19099     things as you, I can scarce think there's any, y'are so slight.
 19100     He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another.
 19101     Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long;
 19102     and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was
 19103     said to: Away!                                          Exit
 19104   FIRST WATCH. A noble fellow, I warrant him.
 19105   SECOND WATCH. The worthy fellow is our general; he's the rock, the
 19106     oak not to be wind-shaken.                            Exeunt
 19107

 19110 
 19111 SCENE III.
 19112 The tent of CORIOLANUS
 19113 
 19114 Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others
 19115 
 19116   CORIOLANUS. We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
 19117     Set down our host. My partner in this action,
 19118     You must report to th' Volscian lords how plainly
 19119     I have borne this business.
 19120   AUFIDIUS. Only their ends
 19121     You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
 19122     The general suit of Rome; never admitted
 19123     A private whisper- no, not with such friends
 19124     That thought them sure of you.
 19125   CORIOLANUS. This last old man,
 19126     Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
 19127     Lov'd me above the measure of a father;
 19128     Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
 19129     Was to send him; for whose old love I have-
 19130     Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd
 19131     The first conditions, which they did refuse
 19132     And cannot now accept. To grace him only,
 19133     That thought he could do more, a very little
 19134     I have yielded to; fresh embassies and suits,
 19135     Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
 19136     Will I lend ear to.  [Shout within]  Ha! what shout is this?
 19137     Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
 19138     In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
 19139 
 19140        Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, VALERIA,
 19141                    YOUNG MARCIUS, with attendants
 19142 
 19143     My wife comes foremost, then the honour'd mould
 19144     Wherein this trunk was fram'd, and in her hand
 19145     The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection!
 19146     All bond and privilege of nature, break!
 19147     Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
 19148     What is that curtsy worth? or those doves' eyes,
 19149     Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
 19150     Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
 19151     As if Olympus to a molehill should
 19152     In supplication nod; and my young boy
 19153     Hath an aspect of intercession which
 19154     Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
 19155     Plough Rome and harrow Italy; I'll never
 19156     Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
 19157     As if a man were author of himself
 19158     And knew no other kin.
 19159   VIRGILIA. My lord and husband!
 19160   CORIOLANUS. These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
 19161   VIRGILIA. The sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd
 19162     Makes you think so.
 19163   CORIOLANUS. Like a dull actor now
 19164     I have forgot my part and I am out,
 19165     Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
 19166     Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,
 19167     For that, 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
 19168     Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
 19169     Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
 19170     I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip
 19171     Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
 19172     And the most noble mother of the world
 19173     Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i' th' earth;       [Kneels]
 19174     Of thy deep duty more impression show
 19175     Than that of common sons.
 19176   VOLUMNIA. O, stand up blest!
 19177     Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
 19178     I kneel before thee, and unproperly
 19179     Show duty, as mistaken all this while
 19180     Between the child and parent.                       [Kneels]
 19181   CORIOLANUS. What's this?
 19182     Your knees to me, to your corrected son?
 19183     Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
 19184     Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
 19185     Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,
 19186     Murd'ring impossibility, to make
 19187     What cannot be slight work.
 19188   VOLUMNIA. Thou art my warrior;
 19189     I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
 19190   CORIOLANUS. The noble sister of Publicola,
 19191     The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
 19192     That's curdied by the frost from purest snow,
 19193     And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!
 19194   VOLUMNIA. This is a poor epitome of yours,
 19195     Which by th' interpretation of full time
 19196     May show like all yourself.
 19197   CORIOLANUS. The god of soldiers,
 19198     With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
 19199     Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
 19200     To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' th' wars
 19201     Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
 19202     And saving those that eye thee!
 19203   VOLUMNIA. Your knee, sirrah.
 19204   CORIOLANUS. That's my brave boy.
 19205   VOLUMNIA. Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
 19206     Are suitors to you.
 19207   CORIOLANUS. I beseech you, peace!
 19208     Or, if you'd ask, remember this before:
 19209     The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
 19210     Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
 19211     Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
 19212     Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not
 19213     Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not
 19214     T'allay my rages and revenges with
 19215     Your colder reasons.
 19216   VOLUMNIA. O, no more, no more!
 19217     You have said you will not grant us any thing-
 19218     For we have nothing else to ask but that
 19219     Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
 19220     That, if you fail in our request, the blame
 19221     May hang upon your hardness; therefore hear us.
 19222   CORIOLANUS. Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
 19223     Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
 19224   VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
 19225     And state of bodies would bewray what life
 19226     We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
 19227     How more unfortunate than all living women
 19228     Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
 19229     Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
 19230     Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
 19231     Making the mother, wife, and child, to see
 19232     The son, the husband, and the father, tearing
 19233     His country's bowels out. And to poor we
 19234     Thine enmity's most capital: thou bar'st us
 19235     Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
 19236     That all but we enjoy. For how can we,
 19237     Alas, how can we for our country pray,
 19238     Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
 19239     Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
 19240     The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
 19241     Our comfort in the country. We must find
 19242     An evident calamity, though we had
 19243     Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
 19244     Must as a foreign recreant be led
 19245     With manacles through our streets, or else
 19246     Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
 19247     And bear the palm for having bravely shed
 19248     Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
 19249     I purpose not to wait on fortune till
 19250     These wars determine; if I can not persuade thee
 19251     Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
 19252     Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
 19253     March to assault thy country than to tread-
 19254     Trust to't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb
 19255     That brought thee to this world.
 19256   VIRGILIA. Ay, and mine,
 19257     That brought you forth this boy to keep your name
 19258     Living to time.
 19259   BOY. 'A shall not tread on me!
 19260     I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
 19261   CORIOLANUS. Not of a woman's tenderness to be
 19262     Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
 19263     I have sat too long.                                [Rising]
 19264   VOLUMNIA. Nay, go not from us thus.
 19265     If it were so that our request did tend
 19266     To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
 19267     The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us
 19268     As poisonous of your honour. No, our suit
 19269     Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
 19270     May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans
 19271     'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
 19272     Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest
 19273     For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
 19274     The end of war's uncertain; but this certain,
 19275     That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
 19276     Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
 19277     Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
 19278     Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
 19279     But with his last attempt he wip'd it out,
 19280     Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
 19281     To th' ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son.
 19282     Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
 19283     To imitate the graces of the gods,
 19284     To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' th' air,
 19285     And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
 19286     That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
 19287     Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
 19288     Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
 19289     He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;
 19290     Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
 19291     Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
 19292     More bound to's mother, yet here he lets me prate
 19293     Like one i' th' stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
 19294     Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
 19295     When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
 19296     Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home
 19297     Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
 19298     And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
 19299     Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,
 19300     That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
 19301     To a mother's part belongs. He turns away.
 19302     Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
 19303     To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
 19304     Than pity to our prayers. Down. An end;
 19305     This is the last. So we will home to Rome,
 19306     And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!
 19307     This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
 19308     But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
 19309     Does reason our petition with more strength
 19310     Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go.
 19311     This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
 19312     His wife is in Corioli, and his child
 19313     Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.
 19314     I am hush'd until our city be afire,
 19315     And then I'll speak a little.
 19316                               [He holds her by the hand, silent]
 19317   CORIOLANUS. O mother, mother!
 19318     What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
 19319     The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
 19320     They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
 19321     You have won a happy victory to Rome;
 19322     But for your son- believe it, O, believe it!-
 19323     Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
 19324     If not most mortal to him. But let it come.
 19325     Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
 19326     I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
 19327     Were you in my stead, would you have heard
 19328     A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
 19329   AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd withal.
 19330   CORIOLANUS. I dare be sworn you were!
 19331     And, sir, it is no little thing to make
 19332     Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
 19333     What peace you'fl make, advise me. For my part,
 19334     I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you
 19335     Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
 19336   AUFIDIUS.  [Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy
 19337       honour
 19338     At difference in thee. Out of that I'll work
 19339     Myself a former fortune.
 19340   CORIOLANUS.  [To the ladies]  Ay, by and by;
 19341     But we will drink together; and you shall bear
 19342     A better witness back than words, which we,
 19343     On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
 19344     Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
 19345     To have a temple built you. All the swords
 19346     In Italy, and her confederate arms,
 19347     Could not have made this peace.                       Exeunt
 19348 
 19349 
 19350 
 19351 
 19352 SCENE IV.
 19353 Rome. A public place
 19354 
 19355 Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
 19356 
 19357   MENENIUS. See you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornerstone?
 19358   SICINIUS. Why, what of that?
 19359   MENENIUS. If it be possible for you to displace it with your little
 19360     finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his
 19361     mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't;
 19362     our throats are sentenc'd, and stay upon execution.
 19363   SICINIUS. Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
 19364     condition of a man?
 19365   MENENIUS. There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet
 19366     your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to
 19367     dragon; he has wings, he's more than a creeping thing.
 19368   SICINIUS. He lov'd his mother dearly.
 19369   MENENIUS. So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now
 19370     than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe
 19371     grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground
 19372     shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with
 19373     his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in
 19374     his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is
 19375     finish'd with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but
 19376     eternity, and a heaven to throne in.
 19377   SICINIUS. Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.
 19378   MENENIUS. I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother
 19379     shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is
 19380     milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find. And all this
 19381     is 'long of you.
 19382   SICINIUS. The gods be good unto us!
 19383   MENENIUS. No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto us.
 19384     When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to
 19385     break our necks, they respect not us.
 19386 
 19387                            Enter a MESSENGER
 19388 
 19389   MESSENGER. Sir, if you'd save your life, fly to your house.
 19390     The plebeians have got your fellow tribune
 19391     And hale him up and down; all swearing if
 19392     The Roman ladies bring not comfort home
 19393     They'll give him death by inches.
 19394 
 19395                          Enter another MESSENGER
 19396 
 19397   SICINIUS. What's the news?
 19398   SECOND MESSENGER. Good news, good news! The ladies have prevail'd,
 19399     The Volscians are dislodg'd, and Marcius gone.
 19400     A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
 19401     No, not th' expulsion of the Tarquins.
 19402   SICINIUS. Friend,
 19403     Art thou certain this is true? Is't most certain?
 19404   SECOND MESSENGER. As certain as I know the sun is fire.
 19405     Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
 19406     Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide
 19407     As the recomforted through th' gates. Why, hark you!
 19408                   [Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together]
 19409     The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries, and fifes,
 19410     Tabors and cymbals, and the shouting Romans,
 19411     Make the sun dance. Hark you!               [A shout within]
 19412   MENENIUS. This is good news.
 19413     I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
 19414     Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
 19415     A city full; of tribunes such as you,
 19416     A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
 19417     This morning for ten thousand of your throats
 19418     I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
 19419                                    [Sound still with the shouts]
 19420   SICINIUS. First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
 19421     Accept my thankfulness.
 19422   SECOND MESSENGER. Sir, we have all
 19423     Great cause to give great thanks.
 19424   SICINIUS. They are near the city?
 19425   MESSENGER. Almost at point to enter.
 19426   SICINIUS. We'll meet them,
 19427     And help the joy.                                     Exeunt

 19432 SCENE V.
 19433 Rome. A street near the gate
 19434 
 19435 Enter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, passing over the stage,
 19436 'With other LORDS
 19437 
 19438   FIRST SENATOR. Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
 19439     Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
 19440     And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.
 19441     Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
 19442     Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
 19443   ALL. Welcome, ladies, welcome!
 19444                     [A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt]
 19445 
 19446 
 19447 
 19448 
 19449 SCENE VI.
 19450 Corioli. A public place
 19451 
 19452 Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with attendents
 19453 
 19454   AUFIDIUS. Go tell the lords o' th' city I am here;
 19455     Deliver them this paper' having read it,
 19456     Bid them repair to th' market-place, where I,
 19457     Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
 19458     Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
 19459     The city ports by this hath enter'd and
 19460     Intends t' appear before the people, hoping
 19461     To purge himself with words. Dispatch.
 19462                                                Exeunt attendants
 19463 
 19464            Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS' faction
 19465 
 19466     Most welcome!
 19467   FIRST CONSPIRATOR. How is it with our general?
 19468   AUFIDIUS. Even so
 19469     As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
 19470     And with his charity slain.
 19471   SECOND CONSPIRATOR. Most noble sir,
 19472     If you do hold the same intent wherein
 19473     You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
 19474     Of your great danger.
 19475   AUFIDIUS. Sir, I cannot tell;
 19476     We must proceed as we do find the people.
 19477   THIRD CONSPIRATOR. The people will remain uncertain whilst
 19478     'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
 19479     Makes the survivor heir of all.
 19480   AUFIDIUS. I know it;
 19481     And my pretext to strike at him admits
 19482     A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
 19483     Mine honour for his truth; who being so heighten'd,
 19484     He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,
 19485     Seducing so my friends; and to this end
 19486     He bow'd his nature, never known before
 19487     But to be rough, unswayable, and free.
 19488   THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Sir, his stoutness
 19489     When he did stand for consul, which he lost
 19490     By lack of stooping-
 19491   AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of.
 19492     Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth,
 19493     Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;
 19494     Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
 19495     In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
 19496     Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
 19497     My best and freshest men; serv'd his designments
 19498     In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
 19499     Which he did end all his, and took some pride
 19500     To do myself this wrong. Till, at the last,
 19501     I seem'd his follower, not partner; and
 19502     He wag'd me with his countenance as if
 19503     I had been mercenary.
 19504   FIRST CONSPIRATOR. So he did, my lord.
 19505     The army marvell'd at it; and, in the last,
 19506     When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
 19507     For no less spoil than glory-
 19508   AUFIDIUS. There was it;
 19509     For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
 19510     At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
 19511     As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
 19512     Of our great action; therefore shall he die,
 19513     And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
 19514                                                       [Drums and
 19515                 trumpets sound, with great shouts of the people]
 19516   FIRST CONSPIRATOR. Your native town you enter'd like a post,
 19517     And had no welcomes home; but he returns
 19518     Splitting the air with noise.
 19519   SECOND CONSPIRATOR. And patient fools,
 19520     Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
 19521     With giving him glory.
 19522   THIRD CONSPIRATOR. Therefore, at your vantage,
 19523     Ere he express himself or move the people
 19524     With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
 19525     Which we will second. When he lies along,
 19526     After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
 19527     His reasons with his body.
 19528   AUFIDIUS. Say no more:
 19529     Here come the lords.
 19530 
 19531                      Enter the LORDS of the city
 19532 
 19533   LORDS. You are most welcome home.
 19534   AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.
 19535     But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
 19536     What I have written to you?
 19537   LORDS. We have.
 19538   FIRST LORD. And grieve to hear't.
 19539     What faults he made before the last, I think
 19540     Might have found easy fines; but there to end
 19541     Where he was to begin, and give away
 19542     The benefit of our levies, answering us
 19543     With our own charge, making a treaty where
 19544     There was a yielding- this admits no excuse.
 19545   AUFIDIUS. He approaches; you shall hear him.
 19546 
 19547             Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours;
 19548                       the commoners being with him
 19549 
 19550   CORIOLANUS. Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier;
 19551     No more infected with my country's love
 19552     Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
 19553     Under your great command. You are to know
 19554     That prosperously I have attempted, and
 19555     With bloody passage led your wars even to
 19556     The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
 19557     Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
 19558     The charges of the action. We have made peace
 19559     With no less honour to the Antiates
 19560     Than shame to th' Romans; and we here deliver,
 19561     Subscrib'd by th' consuls and patricians,
 19562     Together with the seal o' th' Senate, what
 19563     We have compounded on.
 19564   AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords;
 19565     But tell the traitor in the highest degree
 19566     He hath abus'd your powers.
 19567   CORIOLANUS. Traitor! How now?
 19568   AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius.
 19569   CORIOLANUS. Marcius!
 19570   AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think
 19571     I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
 19572     Coriolanus, in Corioli?
 19573     You lords and heads o' th' state, perfidiously
 19574     He has betray'd your business and given up,
 19575     For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
 19576     I say your city- to his wife and mother;
 19577     Breaking his oath and resolution like
 19578     A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
 19579     Counsel o' th' war; but at his nurse's tears
 19580     He whin'd and roar'd away your victory,
 19581     That pages blush'd at him, and men of heart
 19582     Look'd wond'ring each at others.
 19583   CORIOLANUS. Hear'st thou, Mars?
 19584   AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tears-
 19585   CORIOLANUS. Ha!
 19586   AUFIDIUS. -no more.
 19587   CORIOLANUS. Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
 19588     Too great for what contains it. 'Boy'! O slave!
 19589     Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
 19590     I was forc'd to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
 19591     Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion-
 19592     Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that
 19593     Must bear my beating to his grave- shall join
 19594     To thrust the lie unto him.
 19595   FIRST LORD. Peace, both, and hear me speak.
 19596   CORIOLANUS. Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
 19597     Stain all your edges on me. 'Boy'! False hound!
 19598     If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there
 19599     That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
 19600     Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli.
 19601     Alone I did it. 'Boy'!
 19602   AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords,
 19603     Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
 19604     Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
 19605     Fore your own eyes and ears?
 19606   CONSPIRATORS. Let him die for't.
 19607   ALL THE PEOPLE. Tear him to pieces. Do it presently. He kill'd my
 19608     son. My daughter. He kill'd my cousin Marcus. He kill'd my
 19609     father.
 19610   SECOND LORD. Peace, ho! No outrage- peace!
 19611     The man is noble, and his fame folds in
 19612     This orb o' th' earth. His last offences to us
 19613     Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
 19614     And trouble not the peace.
 19615   CORIOLANUS. O that I had him,
 19616     With six Aufidiuses, or more- his tribe,
 19617     To use my lawful sword!
 19618   AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain!
 19619   CONSPIRATORS. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
 19620            [The CONSPIRATORS draw and kill CORIOLANUS,who falls.
 19621                                          AUFIDIUS stands on him]
 19622   LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold!
 19623   AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak.
 19624   FIRST LORD. O Tullus!
 19625   SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
 19626   THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
 19627     Put up your swords.
 19628   AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know- as in this rage,
 19629     Provok'd by him, you cannot- the great danger
 19630     Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
 19631     That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
 19632     To call me to your Senate, I'll deliver
 19633     Myself your loyal servant, or endure
 19634     Your heaviest censure.
 19635   FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body,
 19636     And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded
 19637     As the most noble corse that ever herald
 19638     Did follow to his um.
 19639   SECOND LORD. His own impatience
 19640     Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
 19641     Let's make the best of it.
 19642   AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone,
 19643     And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
 19644     Help, three o' th' chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
 19645     Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully;
 19646     Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
 19647     Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,
 19648     Which to this hour bewail the injury,
 19649     Yet he shall have a noble memory.
 19650     Assist.               Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS
 19651                                           [A dead march sounded]

 19724 SCENE:
 19725 Britain; Italy
 19726 
 19727 
 19728 
 19729 ACT I. SCENE I.
 19730 Britain. The garden of CYMBELINE'S palace
 19731 
 19732   FIRST GENTLEMAN. You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods
 19733     No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
 19734     Still seem as does the King's.
 19735   SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what's the matter?
 19736   FIRST GENTLEMAN. His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
 19737     He purpos'd to his wife's sole son- a widow
 19738     That late he married- hath referr'd herself
 19739     Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded;
 19740     Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd. All
 19741     Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
 19742     Be touch'd at very heart.
 19743   SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King?
 19744   FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,
 19745     That most desir'd the match. But not a courtier,
 19746     Although they wear their faces to the bent
 19747     Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not
 19748     Glad at the thing they scowl at.
 19749   SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so?
 19750   FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing
 19751     Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her-
 19752     I mean that married her, alack, good man!
 19753     And therefore banish'd- is a creature such
 19754     As, to seek through the regions of the earth
 19755     For one his like, there would be something failing
 19756     In him that should compare. I do not think
 19757     So fair an outward and such stuff within
 19758     Endows a man but he.
 19759   SECOND GENTLEMAN. You speak him far.
 19760   FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do extend him, sir, within himself;
 19761     Crush him together rather than unfold
 19762     His measure duly.
 19763   SECOND GENTLEMAN. What's his name and birth?
 19764   FIRST GENTLEMAN. I cannot delve him to the root; his father
 19765     Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
 19766     Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
 19767     But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
 19768     He serv'd with glory and admir'd success,
 19769     So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
 19770     And had, besides this gentleman in question,
 19771     Two other sons, who, in the wars o' th' time,
 19772     Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
 19773     Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
 19774     That he quit being; and his gentle lady,
 19775     Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd
 19776     As he was born. The King he takes the babe
 19777     To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
 19778     Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
 19779     Puts to him all the learnings that his time
 19780     Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
 19781     As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,
 19782     And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court-
 19783     Which rare it is to do- most prais'd, most lov'd,
 19784     A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
 19785     A glass that feated them; and to the graver
 19786     A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
 19787     For whom he now is banish'd- her own price
 19788     Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
 19789     By her election may be truly read
 19790     What kind of man he is.
 19791   SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him
 19792     Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
 19793     Is she sole child to th' King?
 19794   FIRST GENTLEMAN. His only child.
 19795     He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing,
 19796     Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old,
 19797     I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
 19798     Were stol'n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge
 19799     Which way they went.
 19800   SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago?
 19801   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years.
 19802   SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king's children should be so convey'd,
 19803     So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
 19804     That could not trace them!
 19805   FIRST GENTLEMAN. Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
 19806     Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
 19807     Yet is it true, sir.
 19808   SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do well believe you.
 19809   FIRST GENTLEMAN. We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
 19810     The Queen, and Princess.                              Exeunt
 19811 
 19812               Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS, and IMOGEN
 19813 
 19814   QUEEN. No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
 19815     After the slander of most stepmothers,
 19816     Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but
 19817     Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
 19818     That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
 19819     So soon as I can win th' offended King,
 19820     I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
 19821     The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
 19822     You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
 19823     Your wisdom may inform you.
 19824   POSTHUMUS. Please your Highness,
 19825     I will from hence to-day.
 19826   QUEEN. You know the peril.
 19827     I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
 19828     The pangs of barr'd affections, though the King
 19829     Hath charg'd you should not speak together.             Exit
 19830   IMOGEN. O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
 19831     Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
 19832     I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing-
 19833     Always reserv'd my holy duty- what
 19834     His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
 19835     And I shall here abide the hourly shot
 19836     Of angry eyes, not comforted to live
 19837     But that there is this jewel in the world
 19838     That I may see again.
 19839   POSTHUMUS. My queen! my mistress!
 19840     O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
 19841     To be suspected of more tenderness
 19842     Than doth become a man. I will remain
 19843     The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth;
 19844     My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
 19845     Who to my father was a friend, to me
 19846     Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
 19847     And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
 19848     Though ink be made of gall.
 19849 
 19850                      Re-enter QUEEN
 19851 
 19852   QUEEN. Be brief, I pray you.
 19853     If the King come, I shall incur I know not
 19854     How much of his displeasure. [Aside] Yet I'll move him
 19855     To walk this way. I never do him wrong
 19856     But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
 19857     Pays dear for my offences.                              Exit
 19858   POSTHUMUS. Should we be taking leave
 19859     As long a term as yet we have to live,
 19860     The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
 19861   IMOGEN. Nay, stay a little.
 19862     Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
 19863     Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
 19864     This diamond was my mother's; take it, heart;
 19865     But keep it till you woo another wife,
 19866     When Imogen is dead.
 19867   POSTHUMUS. How, how? Another?
 19868     You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
 19869     And sear up my embracements from a next
 19870     With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here
 19871                                               [Puts on the ring]
 19872     While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
 19873     As I my poor self did exchange for you,
 19874     To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
 19875     I still win of you. For my sake wear this;
 19876     It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
 19877     Upon this fairest prisoner.     [Puts a bracelet on her arm]
 19878   IMOGEN. O the gods!
 19879     When shall we see again?
 19880 
 19881                   Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS
 19882 
 19883   POSTHUMUS. Alack, the King!
 19884   CYMBELINE. Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight
 19885     If after this command thou fraught the court
 19886     With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
 19887     Thou'rt poison to my blood.
 19888   POSTHUMUS. The gods protect you,
 19889     And bless the good remainders of the court!
 19890     I am gone.                                              Exit
 19891   IMOGEN. There cannot be a pinch in death
 19892     More sharp than this is.
 19893   CYMBELINE. O disloyal thing,
 19894     That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
 19895     A year's age on me!
 19896   IMOGEN. I beseech you, sir,
 19897     Harm not yourself with your vexation.
 19898     I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
 19899     Subdues all pangs, all fears.
 19900   CYMBELINE. Past grace? obedience?
 19901   IMOGEN. Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.
 19902   CYMBELINE. That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
 19903   IMOGEN. O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle,
 19904     And did avoid a puttock.
 19905   CYMBELINE. Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
 19906     A seat for baseness.
 19907   IMOGEN. No; I rather added
 19908     A lustre to it.
 19909   CYMBELINE. O thou vile one!
 19910   IMOGEN. Sir,
 19911     It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.
 19912     You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
 19913     A man worth any woman; overbuys me
 19914     Almost the sum he pays.
 19915   CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad?
 19916   IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were
 19917     A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
 19918     Our neighbour shepherd's son!
 19919 
 19920                           Re-enter QUEEN
 19921 
 19922   CYMBELINE. Thou foolish thing!
 19923     [To the QUEEN] They were again together. You have done
 19924     Not after our command. Away with her,
 19925     And pen her up.
 19926   QUEEN. Beseech your patience.- Peace,
 19927     Dear lady daughter, peace!- Sweet sovereign,
 19928     Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
 19929     Out of your best advice.
 19930   CYMBELINE. Nay, let her languish
 19931     A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
 19932     Die of this folly.                          Exit, with LORDS
 19933 
 19934                           Enter PISANIO
 19935 
 19936   QUEEN. Fie! you must give way.
 19937     Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
 19938   PISANIO. My lord your son drew on my master.
 19939   QUEEN. Ha!
 19940     No harm, I trust, is done?
 19941   PISANIO. There might have been,
 19942     But that my master rather play'd than fought,
 19943     And had no help of anger; they were parted
 19944     By gentlemen at hand.
 19945   QUEEN. I am very glad on't.
 19946   IMOGEN. Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
 19947     To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
 19948     I would they were in Afric both together;
 19949     Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
 19950     The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
 19951   PISANIO. On his command. He would not suffer me
 19952     To bring him to the haven; left these notes
 19953     Of what commands I should be subject to,
 19954     When't pleas'd you to employ me.
 19955   QUEEN. This hath been
 19956     Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour
 19957     He will remain so.
 19958   PISANIO. I humbly thank your Highness.
 19959   QUEEN. Pray walk awhile.
 19960   IMOGEN. About some half-hour hence,
 19961     Pray you speak with me. You shall at least
 19962     Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.        Exeunt
 19963

 19967 SCENE II.
 19968 Britain. A public place
 19969 
 19970 Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS
 19971 
 19972   FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
 19973     of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out,
 19974     air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
 19975   CLOTEN. If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
 19976   SECOND LORD. [Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
 19977   FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
 19978     hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
 19979   SECOND LORD. [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
 19980     side the town.
 19981   CLOTEN. The villain would not stand me.
 19982   SECOND LORD. [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
 19983     face.
 19984   FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
 19985     added to your having, gave you some ground.
 19986   SECOND LORD. [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
 19987     Puppies!
 19988   CLOTEN. I would they had not come between us.
 19989   SECOND LORD. [Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a
 19990     fool you were upon the ground.
 19991   CLOTEN. And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
 19992   SECOND LORD. [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
 19993     damn'd.
 19994   FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
 19995     not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection
 19996     of her wit.
 19997   SECOND LORD. [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection
 19998     should hurt her.
 19999   CLOTEN. Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt
 20000     done!
 20001   SECOND LORD. [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
 20002     an ass, which is no great hurt.
 20003   CLOTEN. You'll go with us?
 20004   FIRST LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
 20005   CLOTEN. Nay, come, let's go together.
 20006   SECOND LORD. Well, my lord.                             Exeunt

 20011 SCENE III.
 20012 Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
 20013 
 20014 Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
 20015 
 20016   IMOGEN. I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven,
 20017     And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,
 20018     And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
 20019     As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
 20020     That he spake to thee?
 20021   PISANIO. It was: his queen, his queen!
 20022   IMOGEN. Then wav'd his handkerchief?
 20023   PISANIO. And kiss'd it, madam.
 20024   IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
 20025     And that was all?
 20026   PISANIO. No, madam; for so long
 20027     As he could make me with his eye, or care
 20028     Distinguish him from others, he did keep
 20029     The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
 20030     Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
 20031     Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
 20032     How swift his ship.
 20033   IMOGEN. Thou shouldst have made him
 20034     As little as a crow, or less, ere left
 20035     To after-eye him.
 20036   PISANIO. Madam, so I did.
 20037   IMOGEN. I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack'd them but
 20038     To look upon him, till the diminution
 20039     Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
 20040     Nay, followed him till he had melted from
 20041     The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
 20042     Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
 20043     When shall we hear from him?
 20044   PISANIO. Be assur'd, madam,
 20045     With his next vantage.
 20046   IMOGEN. I did not take my leave of him, but had
 20047     Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
 20048     How I would think on him at certain hours
 20049     Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear
 20050     The shes of Italy should not betray
 20051     Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him,
 20052     At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
 20053     T' encounter me with orisons, for then
 20054     I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
 20055     Give him that parting kiss which I had set
 20056     Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,
 20057     And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
 20058     Shakes all our buds from growing.
 20059 
 20060                         Enter a LADY
 20061 
 20062   LADY. The Queen, madam,
 20063     Desires your Highness' company.
 20064   IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
 20065     I will attend the Queen.
 20066   PISANIO. Madam, I shall.                                Exeunt
 20067 
 20068 
 20069 
 20070 
 20071 SCENE IV.
 20072 Rome. PHILARIO'S house
 20073 
 20074 Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a FRENCHMAN, a DUTCHMAN, and a SPANIARD
 20075 
 20076   IACHIMO. Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then
 20077     of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
 20078     been allowed the name of. But I could then have look'd on him
 20079     without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his
 20080     endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by
 20081     items.
 20082   PHILARIO. You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
 20083     is with that which makes him both without and within.
 20084   FRENCHMAN. I have seen him in France; we had very many there could
 20085     behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
 20086   IACHIMO. This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he
 20087     must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I
 20088     doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
 20089   FRENCHMAN. And then his banishment.
 20090   IACHIMO. Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
 20091     divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it
 20092     but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay
 20093     flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it
 20094     he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?
 20095   PHILARIO. His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have
 20096     been often bound for no less than my life.
 20097 
 20098                        Enter POSTHUMUS
 20099 
 20100     Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as
 20101     suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
 20102     quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman,
 20103     whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is
 20104     I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his
 20105     own hearing.
 20106   FRENCHMAN. Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
 20107   POSTHUMUS. Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
 20108     which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
 20109   FRENCHMAN. Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did
 20110     atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have
 20111     been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore,
 20112     upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.
 20113   POSTHUMUS. By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller;
 20114     rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every
 20115     action to be guided by others' experiences; but upon my mended
 20116     judgment- if I offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not
 20117     altogether slight.
 20118   FRENCHMAN. Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and
 20119     by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the
 20120     other or have fall'n both.
 20121   IACHIMO. Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
 20122   FRENCHMAN. Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which
 20123     may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like
 20124     an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in
 20125     praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
 20126     vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more
 20127     fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less
 20128     attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
 20129   IACHIMO. That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion,
 20130     by this, worn out.
 20131   POSTHUMUS. She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
 20132   IACHIMO. You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.
 20133   POSTHUMUS. Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate
 20134     her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.
 20135   IACHIMO. As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison-
 20136     had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain.
 20137     If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours
 20138     outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she
 20139     excelled many; but I have not seen the most precious diamond that
 20140     is, nor you the lady.
 20141   POSTHUMUS. I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone.
 20142   IACHIMO. What do you esteem it at?
 20143   POSTHUMUS. More than the world enjoys.
 20144   IACHIMO. Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's
 20145     outpriz'd by a trifle.
 20146   POSTHUMUS. You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there
 20147     were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the
 20148     other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
 20149   IACHIMO. Which the gods have given you?
 20150   POSTHUMUS. Which by their graces I will keep.
 20151   IACHIMO. You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl
 20152     light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol'n too. So
 20153     your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and
 20154     the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish'd
 20155     courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
 20156   POSTHUMUS. Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
 20157     convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of
 20158     that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of
 20159     thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
 20160   PHILARIO. Let us leave here, gentlemen.
 20161   POSTHUMUS. Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank
 20162     him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
 20163   IACHIMO. With five times so much conversation I should get ground
 20164     of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had
 20165     I admittance and opportunity to friend.
 20166   POSTHUMUS. No, no.
 20167   IACHIMO. I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
 20168     ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make
 20169     my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and,
 20170     to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
 20171     lady in the world.
 20172   POSTHUMUS. You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion,
 20173     and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt.
 20174   IACHIMO. What's that?
 20175   POSTHUMUS. A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve
 20176     more- a punishment too.
 20177   PHILARIO. Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let
 20178     it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.
 20179   IACHIMO. Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th'
 20180     approbation of what I have spoke!
 20181   POSTHUMUS. What lady would you choose to assail?
 20182   IACHIMO. Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will
 20183     lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the
 20184     court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the
 20185     opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence
 20186     that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd.
 20187   POSTHUMUS. I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I
 20188     hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
 20189   IACHIMO. You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy
 20190     ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from
 20191     tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.
 20192   POSTHUMUS. This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver
 20193     purpose, I hope.
 20194   IACHIMO. I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's
 20195     spoken, I swear.
 20196   POSTHUMUS. Will you? I Shall but lend my diamond till your return.
 20197     Let there be covenants drawn between's. My mistress exceeds in
 20198     goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to
 20199     this match: here's my ring.
 20200   PHILARIO. I will have it no lay.
 20201   IACHIMO. By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient
 20202     testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your
 20203     mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond
 20204     too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have
 20205     trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours-
 20206     provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.
 20207   POSTHUMUS. I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt
 20208     us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon
 20209     her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am
 20210     no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain
 20211     unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill
 20212     opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall
 20213     answer me with your sword.
 20214   IACHIMO. Your hand- a covenant! We will have these things set down
 20215     by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the
 20216     bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and
 20217     have our two wagers recorded.
 20218   POSTHUMUS. Agreed.                Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO
 20219   FRENCHMAN. Will this hold, think you?
 20220   PHILARIO. Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow 'em.
 20221                                                           Exeunt

 20226 SCENE V.
 20227 Britain. CYMBELINE'S palace
 20228 
 20229 Enter QUEEN, LADIES, and CORNELIUS
 20230 
 20231   QUEEN. Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
 20232     Make haste; who has the note of them?
 20233   LADY. I, madam.
 20234   QUEEN. Dispatch.                                 Exeunt LADIES
 20235     Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?
 20236   CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
 20237                                               [Presenting a box]
 20238     But I beseech your Grace, without offence-
 20239     My conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have
 20240     Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
 20241     Which are the movers of a languishing death,
 20242     But, though slow, deadly?
 20243   QUEEN. I wonder, Doctor,
 20244     Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
 20245     Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
 20246     To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
 20247     That our great king himself doth woo me oft
 20248     For my confections? Having thus far proceeded-
 20249     Unless thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet
 20250     That I did amplify my judgment in
 20251     Other conclusions? I will try the forces
 20252     Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
 20253     We count not worth the hanging- but none human-
 20254     To try the vigour of them, and apply
 20255     Allayments to their act, and by them gather
 20256     Their several virtues and effects.
 20257   CORNELIUS. Your Highness
 20258     Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
 20259     Besides, the seeing these effects will be
 20260     Both noisome and infectious.
 20261   QUEEN. O, content thee.
 20262 
 20263                         Enter PISANIO
 20264 
 20265     [Aside] Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
 20266     Will I first work. He's for his master,
 20267     An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!
 20268     Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
 20269     Take your own way.
 20270   CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do suspect you, madam;
 20271     But you shall do no harm.
 20272   QUEEN. [To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
 20273   CORNELIUS. [Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has
 20274     Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
 20275     And will not trust one of her malice with
 20276     A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
 20277     Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
 20278     Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs,
 20279     Then afterward up higher; but there is
 20280     No danger in what show of death it makes,
 20281     More than the locking up the spirits a time,
 20282     To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
 20283     With a most false effect; and I the truer
 20284     So to be false with her.
 20285   QUEEN. No further service, Doctor,
 20286     Until I send for thee.
 20287   CORNELIUS. I humbly take my leave.                        Exit
 20288   QUEEN. Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
 20289     She will not quench, and let instructions enter
 20290     Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
 20291     When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
 20292     I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
 20293     As great as is thy master; greater, for
 20294     His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
 20295     Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
 20296     Continue where he is. To shift his being
 20297     Is to exchange one misery with another,
 20298     And every day that comes comes comes to
 20299     A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
 20300     To be depender on a thing that leans,
 20301     Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
 20302     So much as but to prop him?
 20303                   [The QUEEN drops the box. PISANIO takes it up]
 20304     Thou tak'st up
 20305     Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.
 20306     It is a thing I made, which hath the King
 20307     Five times redeem'd from death. I do not know
 20308     What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;
 20309     It is an earnest of a further good
 20310     That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
 20311     The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
 20312     Think what a chance thou changest on; but think
 20313     Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
 20314     Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King
 20315     To any shape of thy preferment, such
 20316     As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
 20317     That set thee on to this desert, am bound
 20318     To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
 20319     Think on my words.                              Exit PISANIO
 20320     A sly and constant knave,
 20321     Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,
 20322     And the remembrancer of her to hold
 20323     The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
 20324     Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
 20325     Of leigers for her sweet; and which she after,
 20326     Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd
 20327     To taste of too.
 20328 
 20329                    Re-enter PISANIO and LADIES
 20330 
 20331     So, so. Well done, well done.
 20332     The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
 20333     Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
 20334     Think on my words.                   Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES
 20335   PISANIO. And shall do.
 20336     But when to my good lord I prove untrue
 20337     I'll choke myself- there's all I'll do for you.         Exit
 20338 
 20339 
 20340 
 20341 
 20342 SCENE VI.
 20343 Britain. The palace
 20344 
 20345 Enter IMOGEN alone
 20346 
 20347   IMOGEN. A father cruel and a step-dame false;
 20348     A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
 20349     That hath her husband banish'd. O, that husband!
 20350     My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
 20351     Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
 20352     As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
 20353     Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,
 20354     How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
 20355     Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
 20356 
 20357                     Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO
 20358 
 20359   PISANIO. Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome
 20360     Comes from my lord with letters.
 20361   IACHIMO. Change you, madam?
 20362     The worthy Leonatus is in safety,
 20363     And greets your Highness dearly.         [Presents a letter]
 20364   IMOGEN. Thanks, good sir.
 20365     You're kindly welcome.
 20366   IACHIMO. [Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
 20367     If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
 20368     She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I
 20369     Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
 20370     Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
 20371     Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
 20372     Rather, directly fly.
 20373   IMOGEN. [Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
 20374     kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him
 20375     accordingly, as you value your trust.       LEONATUS.'
 20376 
 20377     So far I read aloud;
 20378     But even the very middle of my heart
 20379     Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully.
 20380     You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
 20381     Have words to bid you; and shall find it so
 20382     In all that I can do.
 20383   IACHIMO. Thanks, fairest lady.
 20384     What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
 20385     To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
 20386     Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
 20387     The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
 20388     Upon the number'd beach, and can we not
 20389     Partition make with spectacles so precious
 20390     'Twixt fair and foul?
 20391   IMOGEN. What makes your admiration?
 20392   IACHIMO. It cannot be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys,
 20393     'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
 20394     Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment,
 20395     For idiots in this case of favour would
 20396     Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite;
 20397     Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos'd,
 20398     Should make desire vomit emptiness,
 20399     Not so allur'd to feed.
 20400   IMOGEN. What is the matter, trow?
 20401   IACHIMO. The cloyed will-
 20402     That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
 20403     Both fill'd and running- ravening first the lamb,
 20404     Longs after for the garbage.
 20405   IMOGEN. What, dear sir,
 20406     Thus raps you? Are you well?
 20407   IACHIMO. Thanks, madam; well.- Beseech you, sir,
 20408     Desire my man's abode where I did leave him.
 20409     He's strange and peevish.
 20410   PISANIO. I was going, sir,
 20411     To give him welcome.                                    Exit
 20412   IMOGEN. Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?
 20413   IACHIMO. Well, madam.
 20414   IMOGEN. Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.
 20415   IACHIMO. Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
 20416     So merry and so gamesome. He is call'd
 20417     The Britain reveller.
 20418   IMOGEN. When he was here
 20419     He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
 20420     Not knowing why.
 20421   IACHIMO. I never saw him sad.
 20422     There is a Frenchman his companion, one
 20423     An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves
 20424     A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
 20425     The thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton-
 20426     Your lord, I mean- laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
 20427     Can my sides hold, to think that man- who knows
 20428     By history, report, or his own proof,
 20429     What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
 20430     But must be- will's free hours languish for
 20431     Assured bondage?'
 20432   IMOGEN. Will my lord say so?
 20433   IACHIMO. Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
 20434     It is a recreation to be by
 20435     And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know
 20436     Some men are much to blame.
 20437   IMOGEN. Not he, I hope.
 20438   IACHIMO. Not he; but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
 20439     Be us'd more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
 20440     In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.
 20441     Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
 20442     To pity too.
 20443   IMOGEN. What do you pity, sir?
 20444   IACHIMO. Two creatures heartily.
 20445   IMOGEN. Am I one, sir?
 20446     You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
 20447     Deserves your pity?
 20448   IACHIMO. Lamentable! What,
 20449     To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
 20450     I' th' dungeon by a snuff?
 20451   IMOGEN. I pray you, sir,
 20452     Deliver with more openness your answers
 20453     To my demands. Why do you pity me?
 20454   IACHIMO. That others do,
 20455     I was about to say, enjoy your- But
 20456     It is an office of the gods to venge it,
 20457     Not mine to speak on't.
 20458   IMOGEN. You do seem to know
 20459     Something of me, or what concerns me; pray you-
 20460     Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
 20461     Than to be sure they do; for certainties
 20462     Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
 20463     The remedy then born- discover to me
 20464     What both you spur and stop.
 20465   IACHIMO. Had I this cheek
 20466     To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
 20467     Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
 20468     To th' oath of loyalty; this object, which
 20469     Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
 20470     Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
 20471     Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
 20472     That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
 20473     Made hard with hourly falsehood- falsehood as
 20474     With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
 20475     Base and illustrious as the smoky light
 20476     That's fed with stinking tallow- it were fit
 20477     That all the plagues of hell should at one time
 20478     Encounter such revolt.
 20479   IMOGEN. My lord, I fear,
 20480     Has forgot Britain.
 20481   IACHIMO. And himself. Not I
 20482     Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
 20483     The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
 20484     That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
 20485     Charms this report out.
 20486   IMOGEN. Let me hear no more.
 20487   IACHIMO. O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
 20488     With pity that doth make me sick! A lady
 20489     So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
 20490     Would make the great'st king double, to be partner'd
 20491     With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
 20492     Which your own coffers yield! with diseas'd ventures
 20493     That play with all infirmities for gold
 20494     Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
 20495     As well might poison poison! Be reveng'd;
 20496     Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
 20497     Recoil from your great stock.
 20498   IMOGEN. Reveng'd?
 20499     How should I be reveng'd? If this be true-
 20500     As I have such a heart that both mine ears
 20501     Must not in haste abuse- if it be true,
 20502     How should I be reveng'd?
 20503   IACHIMO. Should he make me
 20504     Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,
 20505     Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
 20506     In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
 20507     I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
 20508     More noble than that runagate to your bed,
 20509     And will continue fast to your affection,
 20510     Still close as sure.
 20511   IMOGEN. What ho, Pisanio!
 20512   IACHIMO. Let me my service tender on your lips.
 20513   IMOGEN. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
 20514     So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
 20515     Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
 20516     For such an end thou seek'st, as base as strange.
 20517     Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
 20518     From thy report as thou from honour; and
 20519     Solicits here a lady that disdains
 20520     Thee and the devil alike.- What ho, Pisanio!-
 20521     The King my father shall be made acquainted
 20522     Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
 20523     A saucy stranger in his court to mart
 20524     As in a Romish stew, and to expound
 20525     His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
 20526     He little cares for, and a daughter who
 20527     He not respects at all.- What ho, Pisanio!
 20528   IACHIMO. O happy Leonatus! I may say
 20529     The credit that thy lady hath of thee
 20530     Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
 20531     Her assur'd credit. Blessed live you long,
 20532     A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
 20533     Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
 20534     For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
 20535     I have spoke this to know if your affiance
 20536     Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord
 20537     That which he is new o'er; and he is one
 20538     The truest manner'd, such a holy witch
 20539     That he enchants societies into him,
 20540     Half all men's hearts are his.
 20541   IMOGEN. You make amends.
 20542   IACHIMO. He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
 20543     He hath a kind of honour sets him of
 20544     More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
 20545     Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur'd
 20546     To try your taking of a false report, which hath
 20547     Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
 20548     In the election of a sir so rare,
 20549     Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
 20550     Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
 20551     Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.
 20552   IMOGEN. All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours.
 20553   IACHIMO. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
 20554     T' entreat your Grace but in a small request,
 20555     And yet of moment too, for it concerns
 20556     Your lord; myself and other noble friends
 20557     Are partners in the business.
 20558   IMOGEN. Pray what is't?
 20559   IACHIMO. Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord-
 20560     The best feather of our wing- have mingled sums
 20561     To buy a present for the Emperor;
 20562     Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
 20563     In France. 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
 20564     Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;
 20565     And I am something curious, being strange,
 20566     To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
 20567     To take them in protection?
 20568   IMOGEN. Willingly;
 20569     And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
 20570     My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
 20571     In my bedchamber.
 20572   IACHIMO. They are in a trunk,
 20573     Attended by my men. I will make bold
 20574     To send them to you only for this night;
 20575     I must aboard to-morrow.
 20576   IMOGEN. O, no, no.
 20577   IACHIMO. Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
 20578     By length'ning my return. From Gallia
 20579     I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
 20580     To see your Grace.
 20581   IMOGEN. I thank you for your pains.
 20582     But not away to-morrow!
 20583   IACHIMO. O, I must, madam.
 20584     Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
 20585     To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night.
 20586     I have outstood my time, which is material
 20587     'To th' tender of our present.
 20588   IMOGEN. I will write.
 20589     Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept
 20590     And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.           Exeunt

 20606 ACT II. SCENE I.
 20607 Britain. Before CYMBELINE'S palace
 20608 
 20609 Enter CLOTEN and the two LORDS
 20610 
 20611   CLOTEN. Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack,
 20612     upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and
 20613     then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
 20614     borrowed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my
 20615     pleasure.
 20616   FIRST LORD. What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your
 20617     bowl.
 20618   SECOND LORD. [Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it
 20619     would have run all out.
 20620   CLOTEN. When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any
 20621     standers-by to curtail his oaths. Ha?
 20622   SECOND LORD. No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them.
 20623   CLOTEN. Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been
 20624     one of my rank!
 20625   SECOND LORD. [Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.
 20626   CLOTEN. I am not vex'd more at anything in th' earth. A pox on't! I
 20627     had rather not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me,
 20628     because of the Queen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful
 20629     of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody
 20630     can match.
 20631   SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
 20632     cock, with your comb on.
 20633   CLOTEN. Sayest thou?
 20634   SECOND LORD. It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
 20635     companion that you give offence to.
 20636   CLOTEN. No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to
 20637     my inferiors.
 20638   SECOND LORD. Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
 20639   CLOTEN. Why, so I say.
 20640   FIRST LORD. Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court
 20641     to-night?
 20642   CLOTEN. A stranger, and I not known on't?
 20643   SECOND LORD. [Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
 20644     not.
 20645   FIRST LORD. There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of
 20646     Leonatus' friends.
 20647   CLOTEN. Leonatus? A banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever
 20648     he be. Who told you of this stranger?
 20649   FIRST LORD. One of your lordship's pages.
 20650   CLOTEN. Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation
 20651     in't?
 20652   SECOND LORD. You cannot derogate, my lord.
 20653   CLOTEN. Not easily, I think.
 20654   SECOND LORD. [Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues,
 20655     being foolish, do not derogate.
 20656   CLOTEN. Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at
 20657     bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
 20658   SECOND LORD. I'll attend your lordship.
 20659                                     Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD
 20660     That such a crafty devil as is his mother
 20661     Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
 20662     Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
 20663     Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
 20664     And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
 20665     Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
 20666     Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
 20667     A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
 20668     More hateful than the foul expulsion is
 20669     Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
 20670     Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
 20671     The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
 20672     That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
 20673     T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!         Exit
 20674 
 20675

 20677 
 20678 SCENE II.
 20679 Britain. IMOGEN'S bedchamber in CYMBELINE'S palace; a trunk in one corner
 20680 
 20681 Enter IMOGEN in her bed, and a LADY attending
 20682 
 20683   IMOGEN. Who's there? My woman? Helen?
 20684   LADY. Please you, madam.
 20685   IMOGEN. What hour is it?
 20686   LADY. Almost midnight, madam.
 20687   IMOGEN. I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak;
 20688     Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
 20689     Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
 20690     And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,
 20691     I prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz'd me wholly.    Exit LADY
 20692     To your protection I commend me, gods.
 20693     From fairies and the tempters of the night
 20694     Guard me, beseech ye!
 20695                           [Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk]
 20696   IACHIMO. The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
 20697     Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
 20698     Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
 20699     The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
 20700     How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily,
 20701     And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
 20702     But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
 20703     How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
 20704     Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper
 20705     Bows toward her and would under-peep her lids
 20706     To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied
 20707     Under these windows white and azure, lac'd
 20708     With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design
 20709     To note the chamber. I will write all down:
 20710     Such and such pictures; there the window; such
 20711     Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures-
 20712     Why, such and such; and the contents o' th' story.
 20713     Ah, but some natural notes about her body
 20714     Above ten thousand meaner movables
 20715     Would testify, t' enrich mine inventory.
 20716     O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
 20717     And be her sense but as a monument,
 20718     Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;
 20719                                        [Taking off her bracelet]
 20720     As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
 20721     'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
 20722     As strongly as the conscience does within,
 20723     To th' madding of her lord. On her left breast
 20724     A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
 20725     I' th' bottom of a cowslip. Here's a voucher
 20726     Stronger than ever law could make; this secret
 20727     Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
 20728     The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
 20729     Why should I write this down that's riveted,
 20730     Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
 20731     The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
 20732     Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.
 20733     To th' trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
 20734     Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
 20735     May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
 20736     Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.  [Clock strikes]
 20737     One, two, three. Time, time!             Exit into the trunk
 20738 
 20739 
 20740 
 20741 
 20742 SCENE III.
 20743 CYMBELINE'S palace. An ante-chamber adjoining IMOGEN'S apartments
 20744 
 20745 Enter CLOTEN and LORDS
 20746 
 20747   FIRST LORD. Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most
 20748     coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
 20749   CLOTEN. It would make any man cold to lose.
 20750   FIRST LORD. But not every man patient after the noble temper of
 20751     your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
 20752   CLOTEN. Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this
 20753     foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning,
 20754     is't not?
 20755   FIRST LORD. Day, my lord.
 20756   CLOTEN. I would this music would come. I am advised to give her
 20757     music a mornings; they say it will penetrate.
 20758 
 20759                        Enter musicians
 20760 
 20761     Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so.
 20762     We'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but
 20763     I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited
 20764     thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to
 20765     it- and then let her consider.
 20766 
 20767                  SONG
 20768 
 20769       Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
 20770         And Phoebus 'gins arise,
 20771       His steeds to water at those springs
 20772         On chalic'd flow'rs that lies;
 20773       And winking Mary-buds begin
 20774         To ope their golden eyes.
 20775       With everything that pretty bin,
 20776         My lady sweet, arise;
 20777           Arise, arise!
 20778 
 20779     So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music
 20780     the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which
 20781     horsehairs and calves' guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
 20782     boot, can never amend.                      Exeunt musicians
 20783 
 20784                     Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
 20785 
 20786   SECOND LORD. Here comes the King.
 20787   CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up
 20788     so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done
 20789     fatherly.- Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother.
 20790   CYMBELINE. Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
 20791     Will she not forth?
 20792   CLOTEN. I have assail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no
 20793     notice.
 20794   CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new;
 20795     She hath not yet forgot him; some more time
 20796     Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
 20797     And then she's yours.
 20798   QUEEN. You are most bound to th' King,
 20799     Who lets go by no vantages that may
 20800     Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
 20801     To orderly soliciting, and be friended
 20802     With aptness of the season; make denials
 20803     Increase your services; so seem as if
 20804     You were inspir'd to do those duties which
 20805     You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
 20806     Save when command to your dismission tends,
 20807     And therein you are senseless.
 20808   CLOTEN. Senseless? Not so.
 20809
