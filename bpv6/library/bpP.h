/*	A note on coding technique: the checking of return codes
 *	can safely be foregone in some circumstances, to simplify
 *	the code and marginally improve performance.  The general
 *	rule is that while an SDR transaction is open it is not
 *	necessary to check the value returned by an SDR function
 *	UNLESS the result of that function must be non-failure
 *	in order for subsequent operations in the scope of the
 *	same transaction to be safe [e.g., to prevent segmentation
 *	faults].  The reason for this is that sdr_end_xn(), when
 *	it is invoked to conclude the transaction, will itself
 *	fail and back out the transaction if any SDR operation
 *	within the scope of the transaction failed; it is only
 *	(and ALWAYS) necessary to check the value returned by
 *	sdr_end_xn().  Note also that, if you do check the value
 *	returned by an SDR function while a transaction is open
 *	and it indicates failure, it is NOT necessary to abort
 *	the transaction by calling sdr_cancel_xn(); the transaction
 *	has already been aborted.  It is only necessary to return
 *	a failure indication to invoking code and let sdr_end_xn()
 *	at the top of the function stack clean up the transaction
 *	and return -1 to trigger the applicable failure handling.	*/

/*	An ION "node" is a set of cooperating state machines that
 *	together constitute a single functional point of presence,
 *	residing in a single SDR heap, in a DTN-based network.
 *
 *	A single node may be equipped to send and receive bundles
 *	to and from endpoints whose IDs are formed under one or
 *	more "schemes".  For each such scheme the node will have
 *	a single scheme-specific "forwarder", for which scheme-
 *	specific forwarding information may be recorded in the
 *	database.
 *
 *	To utilize the services of the node, an application instance
 *	calls bp_open() to reserve for its own use a specified DTN
 *	endpoint that is registered at this node, and then calls
 *	bp_receive() to extract inbound bundles from the queue of
 *	undelivered inbound bundles for that endpoint and/or calls
 *	bp_send() to issue bundles to some specified endpoint.
 *
 *	The blocks of data that DTN applications exchange among
 *	themselves are termed "application data units" (ADUs).  A
 *	BP forwarder packages ADUs within bundles and then uses
 *	services provided by underlying communication protocols (at
 *	the "convergence layer" and below) to transmit the bundles
 *	to other nodes.							*/
