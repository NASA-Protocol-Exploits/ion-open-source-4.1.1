TODO

1. Make a CLEAR_ASB function in bsp_utils.
2. Add super encryption
3. Extend encrypt functions to support any additional encryption algorithms
4. Perhaps Figure a way to explicity differentiate from not wanting a security block 
   and wanting a security block, but not having the key or rule for it
5. Consider making security block debug print statements togglable from ionsecadmin
6. Create colloboration blocks for pcb/pib for super encryption

Dependent on future ciphersuites
6. Consider making bsp_GetSecResult a single thing for all ciphersuites?
7. Implement cases where ASB has a ciphersuite param
8. Possibly check against list of valid ciphersuite names in getSecurityInfo
