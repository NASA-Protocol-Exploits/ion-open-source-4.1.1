Description: ======================
        This is not Setuptools
        ======================
        
        This is the ``zetuptoolz`` fork of setuptools, which is used to install
        `Tahoe-LAFS`_. It has a `darcs source repository`_ and `issue tracker`_.
        
        For a list of differences between this fork and setuptools, see zetuptoolz.txt.
        
        Note that, to avoid interfering with any setuptools installation, zetuptoolz
        does not install a script called ``easy_install``. There is an ``easy_install_z``
        script, but that is intended only for developers to test differences between
        setuptools and zetuptoolz.

        Using Setuptools and EasyInstall
        --------------------------------
        
        Here are some of the available manuals, tutorials, and other resources for
        learning about Setuptools, Python Eggs, and EasyInstall:
        
        * `The EasyInstall user's guide and reference manual`_
        * `The setuptools Developer's Guide`_
        * `The pkg_resources API reference`_
        * `Package Compatibility Notes`_ (user-maintained)
        * `The Internal Structure of Python Eggs`_
        
        Questions, comments, and bug reports should be directed to the `distutils-sig
        mailing list`_.  If you have written (or know of) any tutorials, documentation,
        plug-ins, or other resources for setuptools users, please let us know about
        them there, so this reference list can be updated.  If you have working,
        *tested* patches to correct problems or add features, you may submit them to
        the `setuptools bug tracker`_.

        * The original design for the ``.egg`` format and the ``pkg_resources`` API was
        co-created by Phillip Eby and Bob Ippolito.  Bob also implemented the first
        version of ``pkg_resources``, and supplied the OS X operating system version
        compatibility algorithm.
        
        * Ian Bicking implemented many early "creature comfort" features of
        easy_install, including support for downloading via Sourceforge and
        Subversion repositories.  Ian's comments on the Web-SIG about WSGI
        application deployment also inspired the concept of "entry points" in eggs,
        and he has given talks at PyCon and elsewhere to inform and educate the
        community about eggs and setuptools.
        
        * Jim Fulton contributed time and effort to build automated tests of various
        aspects of ``easy_install``, and supplied the doctests for the command-line
        ``.exe`` wrappers on Windows.
        
        * Phillip J. Eby is the principal author and maintainer of setuptools, and
        first proposed the idea of an importable binary distribution format for
        Python application plug-ins.
        
        * Significant parts of the implementation of setuptools were funded by the Open
        Source Applications Foundation, to provide a plug-in infrastructure for the
        Chandler PIM application.  In addition, many OSAF staffers (such as Mike
        "Code Bear" Taylor) contributed their time and stress as guinea pigs for the
        use of eggs and setuptools, even before eggs were "cool".  (Thanks, guys!)
